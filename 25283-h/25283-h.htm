<h3><i>FOREWORD</i></h3>

<p><i>The publisher has asked me to write a note of introduction to this book.
Surely it needs none; but it is a pleasant task to write prefaces for other
people's books. When one writes a preface to a book of one's own, one
naturally grovels, deprecates, and has no opportunity to call the friendly
reader's attention to what the author considers the beauties and
significances of the work. How agreeable, then, to be able to do this
service for another.</i></p>

<p><i>Moreover, one hopes that such a service may not be wholly vain. Every
book has its own special audience, for whom&mdash;very likely unconsciously&mdash;it
was written: the group of people, far spread over the curve of earth, who
will find in that particular book just the sort of magic and wisdom that
they seek. And, as every one who has studied the book business knows, books
very often tragically miss just the public that was waiting for them. It is
such an obscure and nebulous problem, getting the book into the hands of
the people to whom it will appeal. One knows that there are thousands of
readers for whom that book (whatever it may be) will mean keen pleasure.
But how is one to find them and bring the volume to their eyes?</i></p>

<p><i>I owe to the "Atlantic Monthly" my own introduction to Miss de la
Roche's writing. Several years ago, when I was acting as a modest periscope
for a publishing house, I read in the "Atlantic" a fanciful little story by
her which seemed to me so delicate and humorous in fancy, so refreshing and
happy in expression, that I wrote to the author in the hope of some day
luring her to offer a book to the house with which I was connected. We had
some pleasant correspondence. Time passed: I fell from the placid ramparts
of the publishing business, into the more noisy but not less happy bustle
of the newspaper world. But still, though I am not a conscientious
correspondent, I managed to keep occasionally in touch with Miss de la
Roche. For a while I seemed highly unsuccessful as her ambassador into the
high court of publishing. Then, one day, lunching with Mr. Alfred Knopf at
a small tavern on Vesey Street (which was subsequently abolished by the New
York City Health Department as being unfit to offer what one of the small
boys in this book calls "nushment") I happened to tell him about Miss de la
Roche's work. I saw his eye, an eye of special clarity and brilliance,
widen and darken with that particular emotion exhibited by a publisher who
feels what is vulgarly known as a "hunch." He said he would "look into" the
matter; and this book is the result.</i></p>

<p><i>The phrase "look into" is perhaps appropriate as applied to this book.
For it is one of those books where the eye of the attentive reader sees
more than a mere sparkling flow of words on a running surface of narrative.
Of course this is not one of those books that "everybody</i> must <i>read."
It is not likely to become fashionable. But it seems to me so truly
charming, so felicitous in subtle touches of humour, so tenderly moved with
an under-running current of wistfulness, that surely it will find its own
lovers; who will be, perhaps, among those who utter the names of Barrie and
Kenneth Grahame with a special sound of voice.</i></p>

<p><i>Perhaps, since I myself was one of a family of three boys, the story of
Angel, Seraph and John, makes a prejudicial claim upon my affection. I must
admit that it is evident the author of the book was never herself a small
boy: sometimes their imperfections are a little too perfect, too femininely
and romantically conceived, to make me feel one of them. They have not
quite the rowdy actuality of Mr. Tarkington's urchins. But the, fact that
the whole story is told with a poet's imagination, and viewed through a
golden cloud of fancy, gives us countervailing beauties that a strictly
naturalistic treatment would miss. Let us not forget that we are in a
"Cathedral Town"; and next door is a Bishop. And certainly in the vigorous
and great-hearted Mary Ellen we stand solidly on the good earth of human
nature "as is."</i></p>

<p><i>It is not the intention of the introducer to anticipate the reader's
pleasure by selfishly pointing out some of the dainty touches of humour
that will arouse the secret applause of the mind. One thing only occurs to
be said. The scene of the tale is said to be in England. And yet, to the
zealous observer, there will seem to be some flavours that are hardly
English. The language of the excellent Mary Ellen, for instance, comes to
me with a distinct cisatlantic sound. Nor can I, somehow, visualize a
planked back garden in an English Cathedral Town. I am wondering about
this, and I conclude that perhaps it is due to the fact that Miss de la
Roche lives in Toronto, that delightful city where the virtues of both
England and America are said to be subtly and consummately blended. Her
story, as simple and refreshing as the tune of an old song, and yet so
richly spiced with humour, perhaps presents a blend of qualities and
imaginations that we would only find in Canada; for the Canadians, after
all, are the true Anglo-Americans. Perhaps they do not like to be called
so? But I mean it well: I mean that they combine the good qualities of both
sides.</i></p>

<p><i>And so one wishes good fortune to this book in its task&mdash;which every
book must face for itself&mdash;of discovering its destined friends. There will
be some readers, I think, who will look through it as through an open
window, into a land of clear gusty winds and March sunshine and volleying
church bells on Sunday mornings, into a land of terrible contradictions, a
land whose emigr&eacute;s look back to it tenderly, yet without too poignant
regret&mdash;the Almost Forgotten Land of childhood.</i></p>

<h2><i><a name="ch1">Chapter I: Buried Treasure</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Probably our father would never have chosen Mrs. Handsomebody to be our
governess and guardian during the almost two years he spent in South
America, had it not seemed the natural thing to hand us over to the
admirable woman who had been his own teacher in early boyhood.</p>

<p>Had he not been bewildered by the sudden death of our young mother, he
might have recalled scenes between himself and Mrs. Handsomebody that would
have made him hesitate to leave three stirring boys under her entire
control. Possibly he forgot that he had had his parents, and a doting aunt
or two, to pad the angularities of Mrs. Handsomebody's rule, and to say
whether or not her limber cane should seek his plumpest and most tender
parts.</p>

<p>Then, too, at that period, Mrs. Handsomebody was still unmarried. As Miss
Wigmore she had not yet captured and quelled the manly spirit of Mr.
Handsomebody. From being a blustering sort of man, he had become, Mary
Ellen said, very mild and fearful.</p>

<p>On his demise Mrs. Handsomebody was left in solitary possession of a tall,
narrow house, in the shadow of the grey Cathedral in the rather grey and
grim old town of Misthorpe. Here, Angel and The Seraph and I were set down
one April morning, fresh from the country house, where we had been born;
our mother's kisses still warm, one might say, on our round young cheeks.</p>

<p>Unaccustomed to restraint, we were introduced into an atmosphere of
drabness and restraint, best typified, perhaps, by the change from our
tender, springy country turf, to the dry, blistered planks of Mrs.
Handsomebody's back yard. Angel, fiery, candid, inconstant; the careless
possessor of a beautiful boys' treble, which was to develop into the
incomparable tenor of today&mdash;next, myself, a year younger, but equally tall
and courageous, in a more dogged way&mdash;then, The Seraph, three years my
junior, he was just five, following where we led with a blind loyalty,
"Stubborn, strong and jolly as a pie."</p>

<p>Truly when I think of us, as we were then, and when I remember how we came
like a wild disturbing wind into that solemn house, I am inclined to pity
Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>Even when she sent us to bed in the colossal four-poster, in the middle of
the afternoon, we were scarcely downcast, for it was not such a bad
playground after all, and by drawing the curtains, we could shut ourselves
completely away from the world dominated by petticoats.</p>

<p>Then there was Mary Ellen, with her "followers," always our firm ally,
brimming with boisterous good health. Looking back, I am convinced that
Mrs. Handsomebody deserves our sympathy.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>It was Saturday morning, and we three were in Mrs. Handsomebody's
parlour&mdash;Angel, and The Seraph, and I.</p>

<p>No sooner had the front door closed upon the tall angular figure of the
lady, bearing her market basket, than we shut our books with a snap, ran on
tiptoe to the top of the stairs, and, after a moment's breathless
listening, cast our young forms on the smooth walnut bannister, and glided
gloriously to the bottom.</p>

<p>Regularly on a Saturday morning she went to market, and with equal
regularity we cast off the yoke of her restraint, slid down the bannisters,
and entered the forbidden precincts of the Parlour.</p>

<p>On other week days the shutters of this grim apartment were kept closed,
and an inquisitive eye, applied to the keyhole, could just faintly discern
the portrait in crayon of the late Mr. Handsomebody, presiding, like some
whiskered ghost, over the revels of the stuffed birds in the glass case
below him.</p>

<p>But on a Saturday morning Mary Ellen swept and dusted there. The shutters
were thrown open, and the thin-legged piano and the haircloth furniture
were furbished up for the morrow. Moreover Mary Ellen liked our company.
She had a spooky feeling about the parlour. Mr. Handsomebody gave her the
creeps, she said, and once when she had turned her back she had heard one
of the stuffed birds twitter. It was a gruesome thought.</p>

<p>When we bounded in on her, Mary Ellen was dragging the broom feebly across
the gigantic green and red lilies of the carpet, her bare red arms moving
like listless antenn&aelig;. She could, when she willed, work vigorously and
well, but no one knew when a heavy mood might seize her, and render her as
useless as was compatible with retaining her situation.</p>

<p>"Och, byes!" she groaned, leaning on her broom. "This Spring weather do be
makin' me as wake as a blind kitten! Sure, I feel this mornin' like as if
I'd a stone settin' on my stomach, an' me head feels as light as
thistledown. I wisht the missus'd fergit to come home an' I could take a
day off&mdash;but there's no such luck for Mary Ellen!"</p>

<p>She made a few more passes with her broom and then sighed.</p>

<p>"I think I'll soon be lavin' this place," she said.</p>

<p>A vision of the house without the cheering presence of Mary Ellen rose
blackly before us. We crowded round her.</p>

<p>"Now, see here," said Angel masterfully, putting his arms about her stout
waist. "You know perfectly well that father's coming back from South
America soon to make a home for us, and that you are to come and be our
cook, and make apple-dumplings, and have all the followers you like."</p>

<p>Now Angel knew whereof he spoke, for Mary Ellen's "followers" were a bone
of contention between her and her mistress.</p>

<p>"Aw, Master Angel," she expostulated, "What a tongue ye have in yer head to
be sure! Followers, is it? Sure, they're the bane o' me life! Now git out
av the way o' the dust, all of yez, or I'll put a tin ear on ye!" And she
began to swing her broom vigorously.</p>

<p>We ran to the window and looked out but no sooner had we looked out than we
whistled with astonishment at what we saw.</p>

<p>First you must know that on the west of Mrs. Handsomebody's house stood the
broad, ivy-clad mansion of the Bishop, grey stone, like the Cathedral; on
the east was a dingy white brick house, exactly like Mrs. Handsomebody's.
In it lived Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer Pegg and their three servants.</p>

<p>To us they seemed very elegant, if somewhat uninteresting people. Mrs.
Mortimer Pegg frequently had carriage callers, and not seldom sallied forth
herself in a sedate victoria from the livery stables. But beyond an
occasional flutter of excitement when their horses stopped at our very
gate, there was little in this prim couple to interest us. So neat and
precise were they as they tripped down the street together, that we called
them (out of Mrs. Handsomebody's hearing) Mr. and Mrs. "Cribbage" Pegg.</p>

<p>Now, on this morning in mid-spring when we looked out of the window our
eyes discovered an object of such compelling interest in the Pegg's front
garden that we rubbed them again to make sure that we were broad awake.</p>

<p>Striding up and down the small enclosure was a tall old man wearing a
brilliant-hued, flowered dressing-gown, that hung open at the neck,
disclosing his long brown throat and hairy chest, and flapping negligently
about his heels as he strode.</p>

<p>He had bushy iron-grey hair and moustache, and tufts of curly grey beard
grew around his chin and ears. His nose was large and sun-burned; and every
now and again he would stop in his caged-animal walk and sniff the air as
though he enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I liked the old gentleman from the start.</p>

<p>"Oo-o! See the funny old man!" giggled The Seraph. "Coat like Jacob an' his
bwethern!"</p>

<p>Angel and I plied Mary Ellen with questions. Who was he? Did he live with
the Peggs? Did she think he was a foreigner? Mary Ellen, supported by her
broom, stared out of the window.</p>

<p>"For th' love of Hiven!" she ejaculated. "If that ain't a sight now! Byes,
it's Mr. Pegg's own father come home from somewheres in th' Indies. Their
cook was tellin' me of the time they have wid him. He's a bit light-headed,
y'see, an' has all his meals in his own room&mdash;th' quarest dishes iver&mdash;an'
a starlin' for a pet, mind ye."</p>

<p>At that moment the old gentleman perceived that he was watched, and
saluting Mary Ellen gallantly, he called out:</p>

<p>"Good-morning, madam!"</p>

<p>Mary Ellen, covered with confusion, drew back behind the curtain. I was
about to make a suitable reply when I saw Mrs. Mortimer Pegg, herself,
emerge from her house with a very red face, and resolutely grasp her
father-in-law's arm. She spoke to him in a rapid undertone, and, after a
moment's hesitation, he followed her meekly into the house.</p>

<p>How I sympathized with him! I knew only too well the humiliation
experienced by the helpless male when over-bearing woman drags him
ignominiously from his harmless recreation.</p>

<p>A bond of understanding seemed to be established between us at once.</p>

<p>The voice of Mary Ellen broke in on my reverie. She was teasing Angel to
sing.</p>

<p>"Aw give us a chune, Master Angel before th' missus gets back! There's a
duck. I'll give ye a pocket full of raisins as sure's fate!"</p>

<p>Angel, full of music as a bird, could strum some sort of accompaniment to
any song on the piano. It was Mary Ellen's delight on a Saturday morning to
pour forth her pent up feelings in one of the popular songs, with Angel to
keep her on the tune and thump a chord or two.</p>

<p>It was a risky business. But The Seraph mounted guard at the window while I
pressed my nose against the glass case that held the stuffed birds and
wondered if any of them had come from South America. "How jolly," I
thought, "to be there with father."</p>

<p>Tum-te-tum-te-tum, strummed Angel.</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"Casey would waltz with the strawberry blonde,</p>
<p class="i8">And the&mdash;band&mdash;played&mdash;on."</p>
</div></div>

<p>His sweet reedy tones thrilled the April air.</p>

<p>And Mary Ellen's voice, robust as the whistle of a locomotive, bursting
with health and spirits, shook the very cobwebs that she had not swept
down.</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"Casey would waltz with th' strawberry blonde,</p>
<p class="i8">And&mdash;the&mdash;band&mdash;play&mdash;don!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Generally we had a faithful subordinate in The
Seraph. He had a rather sturdy sense of
honour. On this spring morning however, I
think that the singing of Mary Ellen must have
dulled his sensibilities, for, instead of keeping a
bright lookout up the street for the dreaded form
of Mrs. Handsomebody, he lolled across the window-sill,
dangling a piece of string, with the April
sunshine warming his rounded back.</p>

<p>And as he dangled the string, Mrs. Handsomebody
drew nearer and nearer. She entered
the gate&mdash;she entered the house&mdash;she was in the
parlour!!</p>

<p>Angel and Mary Ellen had just given their
last triumphant shout, when Mrs. Handsomebody
said in a voice of cold fury:</p>

<p>"Mary Ellen, kindly cease that ribald screaming. David (David is Angel's proper name)
get up instantly from that piano stool and face
me! John, Alexander, face me!"</p>

<p>We did so tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mrs. Handsomebody, "you
three boys go up to your bedroom&mdash;not to the
schoolroom, mind&mdash;and don't let me hear another
sound from you today! You shall get no
dinner. At four I will come and discuss your
disgraceful conduct with you. Now march!"</p>

<p>She held the door open for us while we filed
sheepishly under her arm. Then the door closed
behind us with a decisive bang, and poor Mary
Ellen was left in the torture-chamber with Mrs.
Handsomebody and the stuffed birds.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Angel and I scurried up the stairway. We
could hear The Seraph panting as he laboured
after us.</p>

<p>Once in the haven of our little room we rolled
in a confused heap on the bed, scuffling indiscriminately.
It was a favourite punishment with
Mrs. Handsomebody, and we had a suspicion
that she relished the fact that so much food was
saved when we went dinnerless. At any rate,
we were not allowed to make up the deficiency
at tea-time.</p>

<p>We always passed the hours of our confinement
on the bed, for the room was very small
and the one window stared blankly at the window
of an unused room in the Peggs' house, which
blankly returned the stare.</p>

<p>But these were not dull times for us. As
Elizabethan actors, striding about their bare
stage, conjured up brave pictures of gilded halls
or leafy forest glades, so we little fellows made
a castle stronghold of our bed; or better still, a
gallant frigate that sailed beyond the barren walls
into unknown seas of adventure, and anchored at
last off some rocky island where treasure lay hid
among the hills.</p>

<p>What brave fights with pirates there were,
when Angel as Captain, I as mate, with The
Seraph for a cabin boy, fought the bloody pirate
gangs on those surf-washed shores, and gained
the fight, though far out-numbered!</p>

<p>They were not dull times in that small back
room, but gay-coloured lawless times, when our
fancy was let free, and we fought on empty
stomachs, and felt only the wind in our faces,
and heard the creak of straining cordage. What
if we were on half-rations!</p>

<p>On this particular morning, however, there
was something to be disposed of before we got
to business. To wit, the rank insubordination
of The Seraph. It was not to be dealt with
too lightly. Angel sat up with a dishevelled
head.</p>

<p>"Get up!" he commanded The Seraph, who
obeyed wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Now, my man," continued Angel, with the
scowl that had made him dreaded the South Seas
over, "have you anything to say for yourself?"</p>

<p>The Seraph hung his head.</p>

<p>"I was on'y danglin' a bit o' stwing," he murmured.</p>

<p>"String"&mdash;repeated Angel, the scowl deepening,
"dangling a bit of string! You may be
dangling yourself at the end of a rope before
the sun sets, my hearty! Here we are without
any dinner, all along of you. Now see here,
you'll go right over into that corner by the
window with your face to the wall and stand
there all the time John and I play! An'&mdash;an'
you won't know what we're doing nor where
we're going nor <i>anything</i>&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>The Seraph went, weeping bitterly. He hid
his face in the dusty lace window curtain. He
looked very small. I could not help remembering
how father had said we were to take care of
him and not make him cry.</p>

<p>Somehow that morning things went ill with
the adventure. The savour had gone out of our
play. Two were but a paltry company after all.
Where was the cabin-boy with his trusty dirk,
eager to bleed for the cause? Though we kept
our backs rigorously turned to the window, and
spoke only in whispers, neither of us could quite
forget the presence of that dejected little figure in
the faded holland smock.</p>

<p>After a bit The Seraph's whimpering ceased,
and what was our surprise to hear the chuckling
laugh with which he was wont to signify his
pleasure!</p>

<p>We turned to look at him. His face was
pressed to the window, and again he giggled
rapturously.</p>

<p>"What's up, kid?" we demanded.</p>

<p>"Ole Joseph-an'-his-Bwethern," he sputtered,
"winkin' an' wavin' hands wiv me!"</p>

<p>We were at his side like a shot, and there in
the hitherto blank window of the Peggs' house
stood the old gentleman of the flowered dressing-gown
laughing and nodding at The Seraph!
When he saw us he made a sign to us to open our
window, and at the same instant raised his own.</p>

<p>It took the three of us to accomplish it, for
the window moved unreadily, being seldom raised,
as Mrs. Handsomebody regarded fresh air much
as she regarded a small boy, as something to be
kept in its place.</p>

<p>At last the window rose, protesting and creaking,
and the next moment we were face to face
with our new acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he said, in a loud jovial voice.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said we, and stared.</p>

<p>He had a strong, weather-beaten face, and
wide-open light eyes, blue and wild as the sea.</p>

<p>"Hello, boy!" he repeated, looking at Angel,
"What's your name?"</p>

<p>Now Angel was shy with strangers, so I
usually answered questions.</p>

<p>"His name," I replied then, "is David Curzon
but mother called him Angel, so we jus' keep on
doing it."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the old gentleman. Then he fixed
The Seraph with his eye. "What's the bantling's
name?"</p>

<p>The Seraph, mightily confused at being called
a bantling, giggled inanely, so I replied again.</p>

<p>"His name is Alexander Curzon, but mother
called him The Seraph, so we jus' keep on doing
it too."</p>

<p>"Um-hm," assented the old gentleman, "and
you&mdash;what's your name?"</p>

<p>"John," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, with an odd little smile, "and
what do they keep on calling <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Just John," I answered firmly, "nothing else."</p>

<p>"Who's your father?" came the next question.</p>

<p>"He's David Curzon, senior," I said proudly,
"and he's in South America building a railroad
an' Mrs. Handsomebody used to be his governess
when he was a little boy, so he left us with her,
but some day, pretty soon, I think, he's coming
back to make a really home for us with rabbits
an' puppies an' pigeons an' things."</p>

<p>Our new friend nodded sympathetically.
Then, quite suddenly, he asked:</p>

<p>"Where's your mother?"</p>

<p>"She's in Heaven," I answered sadly, "she
went there two months ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," broke in The Seraph eagerly, "but
she's comin' back some day to make a <i>weally</i>
home for us!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said Angel gruffly, poking him with
his elbow.</p>

<p>"The Seraph's very little," I explained apologetically,
"he doesn't understand."</p>

<p>The old gentleman put his hand in the pocket
of his dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"Bantling," he said with his droll smile, "do
you like peppermint bull's-eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said The Seraph, "I yike them&mdash;one
for each of us."</p>

<p>Whereupon this extraordinary man began
throwing us peppermints as fast as we could
catch them. It was surprising how we began
to feel at home with him, as though we had
known him for years.</p>

<p>He had travelled all over the world it seemed,
and he brought many curious things to the window
to show us. One of these was a starling whose
wicker cage he placed on the sill where the sunlight
fell.</p>

<p>He had got it, he said, from one of the crew
of a trading vessel off the coast of Java. The
sailor had brought it all the way from Devon
for company, and, he added&mdash;"the brute had put
out both its eyes so that it would learn to talk
more readily, so now, you see, the poor little
fellow is quite blind."</p>

<p>"Blind&mdash;blind&mdash;blind!" echoed the starling
briskly, "blind&mdash;blind&mdash;blind!"</p>

<p>He took it from its cage on his finger. It
hopped up his arm till it reached his cheek, where
it began to peck at his whiskers, crying all the
while in its shrill, lonely tones,&mdash;"Blind, blind,
blind!"</p>

<p>We three were entranced; and an idea that
was swiftly forming in my mind struggled for
expression.</p>

<p>If this wonderful old man had, as he said,
sailed the seas from Land's End to Ceylon, was
it not possible that he had seen, even fought
with, real pirates? Might he not have followed
hot on the trail of hidden treasure? My cheeks
burned as I tried to put the question.</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;" I began, "did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" he encouraged. "Did I what, John?"</p>

<p>"Oh, did you," I burst out, "ever see a pirate
ship, an' pirates&mdash;real ones?"</p>

<p>His face lit up.</p>

<p>"Surely," he replied casually, "many an one."</p>

<p>"P'raps&mdash;" ventured Angel, with an excited
laugh, "p'raps you're one yourself!"</p>

<p>The old gentleman searched our eager faces
with his wide-open, sea blue eyes, then he looked
cautiously into the room behind him, and, apparently
satisfied that no one could overhear,
he put his hand to the side of his mouth, and said
in a loud hoarse whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"That I am. Pirate as ever was!"</p>

<p>I think you could have knocked me down with
a feather. I know my knees shook and the room
reeled. The Seraph was the first to recover,
piping cheerfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"I yike piwates!"</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated the old gentleman, reflectively,
"pirate as ever was. The things I've seen and
done would fill the biggest book you ever saw, and
it'd make your hair stand on end to read it&mdash;what
with fights, and murders, and hangings, and
storms, and shipwreck, and the hunt for gold!
Many a sweet schooner or frigate I've sunk, or
taken for myself; and there isn't a port on the
South Seas where women don't hush their children
crying with the fear of Captain Pegg."</p>

<p>Then he added hastily, as though he feared he
had gone too far:</p>

<p>"But I'm a changed man, mark you&mdash;a reformed
man. If things suit me pretty well here
I don't think I shall break out again. It is just
that you chaps seem so sympathetic makes me tell
you all this; but you must swear never to breathe
a word of it, for no one knows but you. My son
and daughter-in-law think I'm an arch&aelig;ologist.
It'd be an awful shock to them to find that I'm a
pirate."</p>

<p>We swore the blackest secrecy, and were about
to ply him with a hundred questions, when we saw
a maid carrying a large tray enter the room behind
him.</p>

<p>Captain Pegg, as I must now call him, gave us
a gesture of warning and began to lower his
window. A pleasant aroma of roast beef came
across the alley. The next instant the flowered
dressing-gown had disappeared and the window
opposite stared blankly as before.</p>

<p>Angel blew a deep breath. "Did you notice,"
he said, "how different he got once he had told
us he was a pirate&mdash;wilder and rougher, and used
more sailor words?"</p>

<p>"However did you guess it first?" I asked
admiringly.</p>

<p>"I think I know a pirate when I see one," he
returned loftily. "But, oh I say, wouldn't
Mrs. Handsomebody be waxy if she knew?"</p>

<p>"An' wouldn't Mary Ellen be scared stiff if
<i>she</i> knew?"</p>

<p>"An' won't we have fun? Hurray!"</p>

<p>We rolled in ecstasy on the much-enduring bed.</p>

<p>We talked excitedly of the possibilities of such
a wonderful and dangerous friendship. And as
it turned out, none of our imaginings equalled
what really happened.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed quickly. As the hands
of our alarm clock neared the hour of four we
obliterated the traces of our sojourn on the bed
as well as we could, and, when Mrs. Handsomebody
entered, she found us sitting in a row on the
three cane-bottomed chairs, on which we hung our
clothes at night.</p>

<p>The scolding she gave us was even longer and
more humiliating to our manhood than usual.
She shook her hard white finger near our faces
and said that for very little she would write to
our father and complain of our actions.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, in conclusion, "give your faces
and hands a thorough washing and comb your
hair, which is disgraceful; then come quietly down
to tea." The door closed behind her.</p>

<p>"What beats me," said Angel, lathering his
hands, "is why that wart on her chin wiggles so
when she jaws us! I can't keep my eyes off it."</p>

<p>"It wiggles," piped The Seraph, as he dragged
a brush over his curls, "'cos it's nervous, an' I
wiggle when she scolds too, 'cos <i>I'm</i> nervous."</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, old man," Angel responded,
gaily, "we'll take care of you."</p>

<p>We were in fine spirits despite our scolding.
Indeed, we almost pitied Mrs. Handsomebody for
her ignorance of the wonders amongst which she
had her being.</p>

<p>Here she was, fussing over some stuffed birds
in a glass case, when a live starling, who could
talk, had perched near her very window sill! She
spent hours in conversation with her Unitarian
minister, while a real pirate lived next door.</p>

<p>It was pitiful, and yet it was very funny. We
found it hard to go quietly down to tea with such
thoughts in our minds, and after five hours in our
bedroom.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The next day was Sunday.</p>

<p>As we sat at dinner with Mrs. Handsomebody
after morning service, we were scarcely conscious
of the large, white dumplings that bulged before
us, with a delicious sticky sweet sauce, trickling
down their dropsical sides. We plied our spoons
with languid interest around their outer edges, as
calves nibble around a straw stack. Our vagrant
minds scoured the Spanish Main with Captain
Pegg.</p>

<p>Suddenly The Seraph spoke in that cock-sure
way of his.</p>

<p>"There's a piwate at Peggs."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"What's that?" she demanded. At the same
instant Angel and I kicked him under cover of
the table.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" repeated Mrs. Handsomebody
sternly.</p>

<p>"Funny ole gennelman at the Cwibbage Peggs,"
replied The Seraph with his mouth full.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody greatly respected Mr.
and Mrs. Mortimer Pegg, and this play of words
on the name incensed her.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand Alexander," she gobbled,
"that you are making <i>game</i> of the Mortimer
Peggs?"</p>

<p>"Yes," giggled the wretched Seraph, "it's a
cwibbage game. You play it wiv Peggs."</p>

<p>"Leave the table instantly!" ordered Mrs.
Handsomebody. "You are becoming unbearable."</p>

<p>The Seraph cast one anguished look at his
dumpling and burst into tears. We could hear
his wails growing ever fainter as he plodded up
the stairs.</p>

<p>"Mary Ellen, remove that dumpling!" commanded
Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>Angel and I began to eat very fast. There
was a short silence; then Mrs. Handsomebody
said didactically:</p>

<p>"The elder Mr. Pegg is a much travelled gentleman,
and one of the most noted arch&aelig;ologists
of the day. A trifle eccentric in his manner perhaps
but a deep thinker. David, can you tell
me what an arch&aelig;ologist is?"</p>

<p>"Something you pretend you are," said Angel,
"and you ain't."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" snapped Mrs. Handsomebody.
"Look it up in your Johnson's when you go upstairs,
and let me know the result. I will excuse
you now."</p>

<p>We found The Seraph lounging in a chair in
the schoolroom.</p>

<p>"Too bad about the dumpling, old boy," I
said consolingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, not too bad," he replied. "Mary Ellen
fetched it up the backstairs to me. I'm vewy
full."</p>

<p>That afternoon we saw Captain Pegg go for
a walk with his son and daughter-in-law. He
looked quite altered in a long grey coat and tall
hat. Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer Pegg seemed
proud to walk with him.</p>

<p>The following day was warm and sunny.
When lessons were over we rushed to our bedroom
window and to our joy we found that the
window opposite was wide open, the wicker cage
on the sill with the starling inside swelling up
and preening himself in the sunshine, while just
beyond sat Captain Pegg smoking a long pipe.</p>

<p>He seemed delighted to see us.</p>

<p>"Avast, my hearties!" he cried. "It's glorious
sailing weather, but I've just been lying at anchor
here, on the chance of sighting you. It does my
heart good, y'see, to talk with some of my own
kind, and leave off pretending to be an arch&aelig;ologist&mdash;to
stretch my mental legs, as it were. Well&mdash;have
you taken your bearings this morning?"</p>

<p>"Captain Pegg," I broke out with my heart
tripping against my blouse, "you said something
the other day about buried treasure. Did you
really find some? And would you mind telling
us how you set about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied meditatively, "many a sack
of treasure trove I've unearthed&mdash;but the most
curious find of all, I got without searching and
without blood being spilt. I was lying quiet
those days, about forty years ago, off the north
of the Orkney islands. Well, one morning I
took a fancy to explore some of the outlying
rocks and little islands dotted here and there.
So I started off in a yawl with four seamen to
row me; and not seeing much but barren rocks
and stunted shrubs about, I bent over the stern
and stared into the sea. It was as clear as crystal.</p>

<p>"As we were passing through a narrow channel
between two rock islands, I bade the men rest
on their oars, for something strange below had
arrested my attention. I now could see plainly,
in the green depths, a Spanish galleon, standing
upright, held as in a vice, by the grip of the two
great rocks. She must have gone down with all
hands, when the greater part of the Spanish
Armada was wrecked on the shores of Britain.</p>

<p>"'Shiver my timbers, lads,' I cried. 'Here'll
be treasure in earnest! Back to the ship for
our diving suits&mdash;booty for everyone, and plum
duff for dinner!'</p>

<p>"Well, to make a long story short, I, and four
of the trustiest of the crew, put on our diving
suits, and soon we were walking the slippery
decks once trodden by Spanish grandees and
soldiers, and the scene of many a bloody fight I'll
be bound. Their skeletons lay about the deck,
wrapped in sea-tangle, and from every crevice
of the galleon, tall, red, and green, and yellow,
and purple weeds had sprung, that waved and
shivered with the motion of the sea. Her decks
were strewn with shells and sand, and in and out
of her rotted ribs frightened fish darted at our
approach. It was a gruesome sight.</p>

<p>"Three weeks we worked, carrying the treasure
to our own ship, and I began to feel as much
at home under water as above it. At last we
set sail without mishap, and every man on board
had his share and some of them gave up pirating
and settled down as inn-keepers and tradesmen."</p>

<p>As the sound of his deep voice ceased, we three
were silent also, gazing longingly into his eyes
that were so like the sea.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;"Captain Pegg," said Angel, in a still,
small voice, "I don't&mdash;s'pose&mdash;you'd know of
any hidden treasure hereabouts? We'd most
awfully like to find some. It'd be a jolly thing
to write and tell father!"</p>

<p>A droll smile flickered over the bronzed
features of Captain Pegg. He brought down
his fist on the window-sill.</p>

<p>"Well, if you aren't chaps after my own
heart!" he cried. "Treasure about here? I
was just coming to that&mdash;and a most curious
happening it is! There was a cabin-boy&mdash;name
of Jenks&mdash;a lad that I trusted and loved like
my own son, who stole the greater part of my
share of the treasure, and, though I scoured the
globe for him&mdash;" the Captain's eyes rolled
fiercely&mdash;"I found neither trace of him nor the
treasure, till two years ago. It was in Madagascar
that I received a message from a dying
man, confessing that, shaken by remorse, he had
brought what was left of the plunder and buried
it in Mrs. Handsomebody's back yard!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Handsomebody's back yard!" We
chanted the words in utter amazement.</p>

<p>"Just that," affirmed Captain Pegg solemnly.
"Jenks found out that I owned the house next
door but he dared not bury the treasure there
because the yard was smoothly sodded, and would
show up any disturbance; while Mrs. Handsomebody's
yard, being covered with planks, was just
the thing. So he simply raised one of the planks,
dug a hole, and deposited the sack containing
the last of the treasure, and wrote me his confession.
And there you are!"</p>

<p>He smiled benignly on us. I longed to hug
him.</p>

<p>The March wind swooped and whistled down
the alley, and the starling gave little sharp twittering
noises and cocked his head.</p>

<p>"When, oh when&mdash;" we burst out&mdash;"tonight?
May we search for it tonight, Captain Pegg?"</p>

<p>He reflected. "No-o. Not tonight. Jenks,
you see, sent me a plan of the yard with a cross
to mark where the treasure lies, and I'll have to
hunt it up so as not to waste our time turning
up the whole yard. But tomorrow night&mdash;yes,
tomorrow at midnight we'll start the search!"</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>At dinner that day the rice pudding had the
flavor of ambrosia. By nightfall preparations
were already on foot.</p>

<p>Firstly the shovel had been smuggled from the
coal cellar and secreted in a corner of the yard
behind the ash barrel together with an iron crowbar
to use as a lever and an empty sack to aid in
the removal of the treasure.</p>

<p>I scarcely slept that night, and when I did my
mind was filled with wild imaginings. The next
morning we were heedless scholars indeed, and at
dinner I ate so little that Mrs. Handsomebody
was moved to remark jocularly that somebody
not a thousand miles away was shaping for a
bilious bout.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Captain Pegg appeared at his
window looking the picture of cheerful confidence.
He said it warmed his heart to be at his old
profession again, and indeed I never saw a merrier
twinkle in any one's eyes. He had found
the plan of the yard sent by Jenks and he had
no doubt that we should soon be in possession
of the Spanish treasure.</p>

<p>"But there's one thing, my lads;" he said
solemnly, "I make no claim whatever to any share
in this booty. Let that be understood. Anything
we find is to be yours entirely. If I were
to take any such goods into my son's house, his
wife would get suspicious, uncomfortable questions would be asked, and it'd be all up with
this arch&aelig;ologist business."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you hide it under your bed?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, she'd be sure to find it," he replied sadly.
"She's into everything. And even if they didn't
locate it till I am dead, they'd feel disgraced to
think their father had been a pirate. You'll
have to take it."</p>

<p>We agreed, therefore, to ease him of the responsibility
of his strangely gotten gain. We
then parted with the understanding that we were
to meet him in the passage between the two houses
promptly at midnight, and that in the meantime
we were to preserve a calm and commonplace
demeanour.</p>

<p>With the addition of four crullers and a slab
of cold bread pudding filched from the pantry,
our preparations were now complete.</p>

<p>We were well disciplined little animals; we
always went to bed without a murmur, but on
this night we literally flew there. The Seraph
ended his prayers with&mdash;"and for this piwate
tweasure make us twuly thankful. Amen."</p>

<p>The next moment we had dived under the bed
clothes and snuggled there in wild expectancy.</p>

<p>From half past seven to twelve is a long
stretch. The Seraph slept peacefully. Angel or
I rose every little while and struck a match to
look at the clock. At nine we were so hungry
that we ate all four crullers. At eleven we ate
the slab of cold bread pudding. After that
we talked less, and I think Angel dozed, but I lay
staring in the direction of the window, watching
for the brightness which would signify that
Captain Pegg was astir and had lighted his gas.</p>

<p>At last it came&mdash;a pale and trembling messenger,
that showed our little room to me in a new
aspect&mdash;one of mystery and grotesque shadows.</p>

<p>I was on my feet in an instant. I shook
Angel's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Up with you!" I whispered, hoarsely. "The
hour has come!"</p>

<p>I knew that drastic measures must be taken
with The Seraph, so I just grasped him under
the armpits and stood him on his feet without
a word. He wobbled for a space, digging his
knuckles in his eyes.</p>

<p>The hands of the clock pointed to ten minutes
to twelve.</p>

<p>Angel and I hastily pulled on our trousers;
and he, who liked to dress the part, stuck a knife
in his belt, and twisted a scarlet silk handkerchief
(borrowed from Mary Ellen) round his head.
His dark eyes glistened under its folds.</p>

<p>The Seraph and I went unadorned, save that
he girt his trusty sword about his stout middle
and I carried a toy bayonet.</p>

<p>Down the inky-black stairs we crept, scarcely
breathing. The lower hall seemed cavernous.
I could smell the old carpets and the haircloth
covering of the chairs. We sidled down the
back hall among goloshes, umbrellas, and Turk's
Head dusters. The back door had a key like
that of a gaol.</p>

<p>Angel tried it with both hands, but though it
grated horribly, it stuck. Then I had a try,
and could not resist a triumphant click of the
tongue when it turned, for Angel was a vain
fellow and took a rise out of being the elder.</p>

<p>And when the moonlight shone upon us in the
yard!&mdash;oh, the delicious freedom of it! We
hopped for joy.</p>

<p>In the passage we awaited our leader. Between
the roofs we could see the low half-moon,
hanging like a tilted bird's nest in the dark blue
sky, while a group of stars fluttered near it like
young birds. The Cathedral clock sounded the
hour of midnight.</p>

<p>Soon we heard the stealthy steps of Captain
Pegg, and we gasped as we saw him, for in place
of his flowered dressing-gown, he wore breeches
and top boots, a loose shirt with a blue neckerchief
knotted at the throat, and, gleaming at
his side, a cutlass.</p>

<p>He smiled broadly when he saw us.</p>

<p>"Well, if you aren't armed&mdash;every man-jack
of you&mdash;even to the bantling!" he cried.
"Capital!"</p>

<p>"My sword, she's <i>weal</i>," said The Seraph
with dignity. "Sometimes I fight giants."</p>

<p>Captain Pegg then shook hands with each of
us in turn, and we thrilled at being treated as
equals by such a man.</p>

<p>"And now to work!" he said heartily. "Here
is the plan of the yard as sent by Jenks."</p>

<p>We could see it plainly by the moonlight, all
neatly drawn out, even to the ash barrel and the
clothes dryer, and there, on the fifth plank from
the end was a cross in red ink, and beside it the
magic word&mdash;Treasure!</p>

<p>Captain Pegg inserted the crowbar in a wide
crack between the fourth and fifth boards, then
we all pressed our full weight upon it with a "Yo
heave ho, my hearties!" from our chief.</p>

<p>The board flew up and we flew down, sprawling
on the ground. Somehow the Captain,
versed in such matters, kept his feet, though he
staggered a bit.</p>

<p>Then, in an instant, we were pulling wildly at
the plank to dislodge it. This we accomplished
after much effort, and a dark, dank recess was
disclosed.</p>

<p>Captain Pegg dropped to his knees and with
his hand explored cautiously under the planks.
His face fell.</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers if I can find it!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Let me try!" I cried eagerly.</p>

<p>Both Angel and I thrust our hands in also and
fumbled among the moist lumps of earth. I felt
an earth-worm writhe away.</p>

<p>Captain Pegg now lighted a match and held it
in the aperture. It cast a glow upon our tense
faces.</p>

<p>"Hold it closer!" implored Angel. "This
way&mdash;right here&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>At the same moment we both had seen the
heavy metal ring that projected, ever so little,
above the surface of the earth. We grasped it
simultaneously and pulled. Captain Pegg lighted
another match. It was heavy&mdash;oh, so heavy!&mdash;but
we got it out&mdash;a fair-sized leather bag
bound with thongs. To one of these was attached
the ring we had first caught sight of.</p>

<p>Now, kneeling as we were, we stared up in
Captain Pegg's face. His wide, blue eyes had
somehow got a different look.</p>

<p>"Little boys," he said gently, "open it!"</p>

<p>There in the moonlight, we unloosed the
fastenings of the bag and turned its contents
out upon the bare boards. The treasure lay disclosed
then, a glimmering heap, as though, out
of the dank earth, we had digged a patch of
moonshine.</p>

<p>We squatted on the boards around it, our heads
touching, our wondering eyes filled with the magic
of it.</p>

<p>"It is the treasure," murmured Angel, in an
awe-struck voice, "real treasure-trove. Will
you tell us, Captain Pegg, what all these things
are?"</p>

<p>Captain Pegg, squatting like the rest of us,
ran his hands meditatively through the strange
collection.</p>

<p>"Why, strike me purple," he growled, "if that
scamp Jenks hasn't kept most of the gold coins
and left us only the silver! But here's three
golden doubloons, all right, one apiece for ye!
And here's ducats and silver florins, and pieces
of eight&mdash;and some I can't name till I get the
daylight on them. It's a pretty bit of treasure
all told; and see here&mdash;" he held up two old
Spanish watches, just the thing for gentlemen
adventurers.</p>

<p>We boys were now delving into the treasure
on our own account, and brought to light a brace
of antiquated pistols, an old silver flagon, a compass,
a wonderful set of chess men carved from
ivory, and some curious shells, that delighted
The Seraph. And other quaint things there were
that we handled reverently, and coins of different
countries, square and round, and some with holes
bored through.</p>

<p>We were so intent upon our discovery that
none of us heard the approaching footsteps till
they were fair upon us. Then, with a start, we
turned, and saw to our horror Mrs. Handsomebody
and Mary Ellen, with her hair in curl-papers,
and, close behind them, Mr. and Mrs.
Mortimer Pegg, scantily attired, the gentleman
carrying a revolver.</p>

<p>"David! John! Alexander!" gobbled Mrs.
Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"Now what d'ye think of that!" came from
Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>"Father! Have you gone quite mad?" cried
Mrs. Pegg.</p>

<p>And&mdash;"Oh, I say Governor&mdash;" stammered the
gentleman with the revolver.</p>

<p>Captain Pegg rose to his feet with dignity.</p>

<p>"These young gentlemen," he said, simply,
"have with my help been able to locate some
buried treasure, stolen from me years ago by a
man named Jenks, and hidden here since two
decades. I hereby renounce all claim to it in
favour of my three brave friends!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pegg was bent over the treasure.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, sir," he said, rather sharply,
"some of this seems to be quite valuable stuff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know the value of it to a penny," replied
his father, with equal asperity, "and I intend it
shall belong solely and wholly to these boys."</p>

<p>"Whatever are you rigged up like that for?"
demanded his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>"As gentlemen of spirit," replied Captain
Pegg, patiently, "we chose to dress the part.
We do what we can to keep a little glamour and
gaiety in the world. Some folk&mdash;" he looked
at Mrs. Handsomebody&mdash;"would like to discipline
it all away."</p>

<p>"I think," said our governess, "that, considering
it is <i>my</i> back yard, I have some claim to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"None at all, Madam&mdash;none at all!" interrupted
Captain Pegg. "By all the rules of treasure-hunting,
the finder keeps the treasure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody was silenced. She did
not wish to quarrel with the Peggs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pegg moved closer to her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Handsomebody," she said, winking her
white eyelashes very fast, "I really do not think
that you should allow your pupils to accept this&mdash;er&mdash;treasure.
My father-in-law has become
very eccentric of late, and I am positive that he
himself buried these things very recently. Only
day before yesterday, I saw that set of ivory
chessmen on his writing table."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Sophia!" shouted Captain
Pegg loudly.</p>

<p>Mr. Mortimer Pegg looked warningly at his
wife.</p>

<p>"All right, Governor! Don't you worry," he
said taking his father's arm. "It shall be just
as you say; but one thing is certain, you'll take
your death of cold if you stay out in this night
air." As he spoke, he turned up the collar of
his coat.</p>

<p>Captain Pegg shook hands grandly with Angel
and me, then he lifted The Seraph in his arms and
kissed him.</p>

<p>"Good-night, bantling," he said, softly.
"Sleep tight!"</p>

<p>He turned then to his son. "Mort," said he,
"I haven't kissed a little boy like that since you
were just so high."</p>

<p>Mr. Pegg laughed and shivered, and they went
off quite amiably, arm in arm, Mrs. Pegg following,
muttering to herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody looked disparagingly at
the treasure. "Mary Ellen," she ordered, "help
the children to gather up that rubbish, and come
in at once. Such an hour it is!"</p>

<p>Mary Ellen, with many exclamations, assisted
in the removal of the treasure to our bedroom.
Mrs. Handsomebody, after seeing it deposited
there, and us safely under the bed-clothes, herself
extinguished the gas.</p>

<p>"I shall write to your father," she said, severely,
"and tell him the whole circumstance. <i>Then</i> we
shall see what is to be done with <i>you</i>, and with the
<i>treasure</i>."</p>

<p>With this veiled threat she left us. We snuggled
our little bodies together. We were cold.</p>

<p>"I'll write to father myself, tomorrow, an'
'splain everything," I announced.</p>

<p>"D' you know," mused Angel, "I b'lieve I'll
be a pirate, 'stead of a civil engineer like father.
I b'lieve there's more in it."</p>

<p>"I'll be an engineer just the same," said I.</p>

<p>"I fink," murmured The Seraph, sleepily, "I
fink I'll jus' be a bishop, an' go to bed at pwoper
times an' have poached eggs for tea."</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch2">Chapter II: The Jilt</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The day after the finding of the Treasure,
Mary Ellen told us that she had seen Captain
Pegg drive away from his son's house in a closed
cab, before we had emerged from the four-poster.
There had been a quarrel, the servants had told
her, and in spite of all his son and daughter-in-law
could do, the peppery Captain had left them,
refusing to divulge the name of his destination.</p>

<p>"And they do say," Mary Ellen declared,
"that he's no more fit to be wanderin' about the
world alone than a babe unborn."</p>

<p>We smiled at the ignorance of women-servants,
and speculated much on the Captain's probable
new adventure. We were confident that he
would return one day, loaded with fresh booty,
and full of tales of the sea.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there was the Bishop. His
house, as I have said stood between us and the
Cathedral. It was a benign house, like a sleepy
mastiff, and seemed to tolerate with lazy indifference the presence of its two narrow, high-backed
neighbours, which with their cold, unblinking
windows, looked like sinister, half-fed
cats.</p>

<p>We had not been long at Mrs. Handsomebody's
before we made friends with Bishop Torrance.
As he walked in his deep, green garden,
one morning, we three watched him enviously
over the brick wall, that separated us. We were
balanced precariously on a board, laid across the
ash barrel, and The Seraph, losing his balance,
fell headlong into a bed of clove pinks, almost at
the Bishop's feet.</p>

<p>When his yells had subsided and explanations
asked, and given, Angel and I were lifted over
the wall, and shaken hands with, and given the
freedom of the garden. We were introduced
to the Bishop's niece, Margery, who was his
sole companion, though we regarded, as one of
the family, the Fountain Boy who blew cool jets
of water through a shell, and turned his laughing
face always upward toward the spires of the
Cathedral.</p>

<p>Thus a quaint friendship sprang up, and,
though the Bishop had not the dash, and boldness
of Captain Pegg, he was an understanding and
high-hearted playfellow.</p>

<p>I think The Seraph was his favourite. Even
then, the dignified elegance of the Bishop's life
appealed to that infant's love of the comfortable,
and it tickled the Bishop immensely to have him
pace solemnly up and down the garden, at his
side, hands clasped behind his back, helping, as
he believed, to "pwepare" the Bishop's sermon.</p>

<p>All three of us were permitted by Mrs. Handsomebody
to join the Cathedral choir.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Thus we had a feeling of proprietorship in
the Bishop and his garden, and his niece, Margery,
and the Fountain Boy. Hence what was our
astonishment and chagrin to see one morning,
from our schoolroom window, a chit of a girl,
smaller than myself, strutting up and down the
Bishop's garden, pushing a doll's perambulator.
She had fluffy golden hair about her shoulders,
and her skirts gave a rhythmic swing as she
turned the corners. Now and then she would
stop in her walk, remove the covering from the
doll, do some idiotic thing to it, and replace the
cover with elaborate care.</p>

<p>We stared fascinated. Then Angel blew out
his lips in disgust, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ain't girls the most sickenin' things?"</p>

<p>"There she goes again, messing with the doll's
quilt," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Le's fwow somefing at her!" suggested The
Seraph.</p>

<p>"Yes, and get into a row with the Bishop,"
answered Angel. "But I don't see myself going
over there to play again. She's spoiled everything."</p>

<p>"I s'pose she's a spoiled child," said The
Seraph, dreamily. "Wonder where her muvver
is."</p>

<p>"I say," said Angel, "let's rap on the pane,
and then when she looks up, we'll all stick our
tongues out at her. That'll scare her all right!"</p>

<p>We did.</p>

<p>When her wondering blue eyes were raised to
our window, what they saw was three white disks
pressed against the glass, with a flattened pink
tongue protruding from each. We glared to see
the effect of this outrage upon her. But the
dauntless little creature never quailed. Worse
than that, she put her fingers to her lips and blew
three kisses at us&mdash;one apiece.</p>

<p>We were staggered. We withdrew our reddened
faces hastily and stared at each other.
We were aghast. Almost we had been kissed by
a girl!</p>

<p>"Let's draw the blind!" said Angel. "She
shan't see us! Then we can peek through the
crack and watch her."</p>

<p>But no sooner was the blind pulled down than
we heard our governess coming and flew to our
seats.</p>

<p>"Boys!" she gobbled, stopping in the doorway,
"what does this mean? The boy who
pulled down that blind stand up!"</p>

<p>Angel rose. "The light hurt my eyes," he
lied feebly, "I aren't very well."</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" snapped Mrs. Handsomebody,
running up the blind with precision, "this room
at its brightest is dim. Your eyes are keen enough
for mischief, sir. Now we shall proceed with
our arithmetic."</p>

<p>We floundered through the Tables, but my
mind still wandered in the Bishop's garden. Resentment
and curiosity struggled for mastery
within me. In my mind's eye I saw her covering
and uncovering the doll. Why did she do it?
What did it feel like to push that "pram"?
Would she drink tea from the Indian Tree cups
and be allowed to strum on the piano? Oh, I
wished she hadn't come! And yet&mdash;anyway, I
was glad I was a boy.</p>

<p>As Fate had it, Angel and The Seraph had to
have their hair trimmed that afternoon. My own
straight blond crop grew but slowly so I was free
for an hour to follow my own devices. Those led
me to climb to the roof of our scullery and from
there mount the high brick wall.</p>

<p>From this vantage point I scanned the surrounding
country for signs of the interloper. There
she was! There she was!</p>

<p>Down on her knees at the fountain's brink, her
curls almost touching the water, she was sailing
boats made of hollyhock petals. The doll's
perambulator stood near by.</p>

<p>Noiselessly I crept along the wall till I reached
the cherry tree that stood in the corner. Reaching
its friendly branches, I let myself down, hand
over hand, till, at last, I dropped lightly on the
soft turf.</p>

<p>I sauntered then to her side, and gazed at her
moodily. If she saw me she gave no sign.</p>

<p>In spite of myself I grew interested in the way
she manipulated those boat petals. Evidently
there was some system in her game but it was new
to me.</p>

<p>"That little black seed on this boat is Jason,"
she said at last, without looking up, "and these
little white seeds are his comrades. They're
searching for The Golden Fleece. My hair is the
Fleece. Come and play!"</p>

<p>Mutely I squatted beside her, and our two faces
peered at each other in the mirror of the pool.</p>

<p>She gave a funny eager little laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "we match beautifully, don't
we? Your hair is yellow and my hair is yellow,
my eyes are blue and your eyes are blue."</p>

<p>"My eyes are grey, like father's," I objected.</p>

<p>"No, they're blue like mine. We match beautifully.
Let's play something else." Before I
could prevent her, she had swept Jason and his
crew away, and, snatching the doll from the
perambulator, had set it on the fountain's edge
between us.</p>

<p>"This is Dorothea," she announced, "isn't she
sweet? I'm her mother. You should be the
father, and Dorothea should want to paddle her
toes in the fountain. Now you hold her&mdash;so."</p>

<p>Before I was aware of it I was made to grasp
the puppet by the waist, while her mistress began
to rearrange the pillows in the "pram."</p>

<p>I glanced fearfully at our schoolroom window,
lest I should be discovered in so unmanly a posture.
It seemed that we were quite alone and unobserved.</p>

<p>A drowsy pleasure stole over my senses. The
humming of the bees in the Canterbury Bells became
a chant as of sirens. Dorothea's silly pink
feet dangled in the pool. Surreptitiously I slipped
my hand under water and felt them. They were
getting spongy and seemed likely to come off.
Truly there were compensations for such slavery.</p>

<p>My companion returned and sat down with her
slim body close to mine.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" she cooed.</p>

<p>"John."</p>

<p>"Oh. Mine is Jane. You may call me Jenny.
I'm visiting Aunt Margery. The Bishop is my
great-uncle. What are your brothers' names?"</p>

<p>"Angel and The Seraph. <i>They don't</i> like
girls." Instantly I wondered why I had said
that. Did I like girls? <i>Not much.</i> But I
didn't want Angel interfering in this. He had
better keep away.</p>

<p>"My father is a judge. He sends bad men to
prison."</p>

<p>"My father"&mdash;I was very proud of him&mdash;"is a
civil engineer. He's in South America building
a railroad, so that's why we live with Mrs.
Handsomebody. But some day he's coming back
to make a home for us. When I grow up I shall
be an engineer too, and build bridges over
canyons."</p>

<p>"What's canyons? Hold Dorothea tighter."</p>

<p>I explained canyons at length.</p>

<p>"P'raps I'll take you with me," I added weakly.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands rapturously.</p>

<p>"Oh, what fun!" she gurgled. "I can keep
house and hang my washing 'cross the canyon
to dry!"</p>

<p>Frankly I did not relish the thought of my canyon's
being thus desecrated. I determined never
to allow her to do any such thing, but, at the
moment I was willing to indulge her fancy.</p>

<p>"Yes," she prattled on, "I'll wheel Dorothea
up and down the bridge and watch you work."</p>

<p>Now there was some sense in that. What man
does not enjoy being admired while he does
things? In fact Jane had hit upon a great
elemental truth when she suggested this. From
that moment I was hers.</p>

<p>Laying Dorothea, toes up, on the grass I proceeded
to lead Jane into the most cherished realms
of my fancy. Together we sailed those "perilous
seas in faery lands forlorn," dabbling our hands
in the fountain, while the golden August sunshine
kissed our necks.</p>

<p>I said not a word of this at tea. I munched
my bread and butter in a sort of haze, scarcely
conscious of the subdued conversation led by Mrs.
Handsomebody, until I heard her say,</p>

<p>"A little great-niece of Bishop Torrance is visiting
next door. You are therefore invited to take
tea with her tomorrow afternoon. I trust you
will conduct yourselves with decency at table, and
remember that a frail little girl is not to be played
with as a headlong boy."</p>

<p>I felt that she couldn't tell me anything about
frail little girls, but I kept my knowledge to myself.
The Seraph said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was you ever a fwail little gel, Mrs. Handsomebody?"
Our governess fixed him with her eye.</p>

<p>"I was a most decorous and obedient little girl,
Alexander, and asked no impertinent questions of
my elders."</p>

<p>"Was Mary Ellen a fwail little gel?" persisted
The Seraph.</p>

<p>"No," snapped Mrs. Handsomebody, "judging
from her characteristics as a servant, I should
say that she was a very riotous, rude little girl.
Now drink your milk."</p>

<p>"I yike wiotous wude people," said The Seraph
with his face in the tumbler; the milk trickled
down his chin.</p>

<p>"Leave the table, Alexander," commanded Mrs.
Handsomebody, "your conduct is quite inexcusable."
The Seraph departed, weeping.</p>

<p>All that evening I thought about Jane. I had
no heart for a pillow fight. At night I dreamed
of her, and saw her weekly washing, suspended
from a line, fluttering in the wind that raced along
my canyon.</p>

<p>I strained toward the hour when I should meet
her at tea. I had never felt like this before.
True, I had once conceived a violent fancy for
a fat young woman in the pastry shop, but she
had been replaced by a thin young woman who
did not appeal to me, and the episode was forgotten.</p>

<p>But, oh, this bitter-sweetness of my love for
Jane! My despair when I found that she was to
sit next Angel at tea, till I discovered that, seated
opposite, I could stare at her, and admire how she
nibbled her almond cake and sipped tea from an
apple-green cup.</p>

<p>After tea we played musical chairs, in the library, with Margery at the piano. First marched
The Seraph with his brown curls bobbing; and
after him, the stout Bishop in his gaiters; next
Angel; then Jane on tiptoes; and lastly myself in
squeaky new boots.</p>

<p>Seraph and the Bishop were soon out of it.
They were invariably beaten in our games, though
afterward they always seemed to think they had
won. So Angel, Jane, and I were left, prancing
around two solemn carved chairs. The music
ceased with a crash. Jane leaped to one chair
while Angel and I fell simultaneously upon the
other. We both clung to it desperately, but he
dislodged me, inch by inch, and I, furious at being
balked in my pursuit of Jane, struck him twice in
the ribs, then ran into the dim hall and hid myself.</p>

<p>There Jane found me, and there her tender lips
kissed my hot cheek, and she squeezed me in her
arms. For a moment we did not speak, then she
whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish <i>you</i> had got the chair, John. I love
you best of all."</p>

<p>That night I hung about the kitchen while
Mary Ellen was setting bread to rise. The time
had come when I must speak to some fellow
creature of this tremendous new element that had
come into my life. I watched Mary Ellen's stout
red arms as she manipulated the dough, in much
perplexity. The kitchen was hot, the kettle sang,
it seemed a moment for confidence, yet words
were hard to find.</p>

<p>At last I got out desperately:</p>

<p>"Mary Ellen, what is love like?"</p>

<p>"Love is it, Masther John? What do the likes
o' me know about love thin?" She smiled
broadly, as she dexterously shifted the puffy white
mass.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>you</i> know," I persisted, "'cos you've been
in it, often. You've had lots of 'followers' now,
Mary Ellen, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, thin, if ye must know, I'll tell ye point
blunt to kape out av it. It's an awful thing whin
it gits the best av ye."</p>

<p>"But what's it <i>feel like</i>?" I probed.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen wiped the flour off each red finger
in turn, and gazed into the flame of the
lamp.</p>

<p>"It's like this," she said solemnly, "ye burns
in yer insides till ye feel like ye had a furnace
blazin' there. Thin whin it seems ye must bust
wid the flarin' av it, ye suddintly turns cowld as
ice, an' yer sowl do shrivil up wid fear. An'
thin, at last, ye fergit all about it till the nixt
wan happens along. Och&mdash;I haven't had a sphell
fer months! This is an awful dull place. I
think I'll be quittin' it soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Mary Ellen!" I cried, alarmed,
"you mustn't leave us! When Jane and I get
married you can come and live with us." I
blushed furiously.</p>

<p>"And who might Jane be?" demanded Mary
Ellen, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"She's the Bishop's great-niece," I explained
proudly. "I love her terribly, Mary Ellen. It
hurts in here." I pressed my hand on my
stomach.</p>

<p>"Well, well." She shook her head commiseratingly.
"I'm sorry fer ye, Masther John&mdash;sthartin'
off like this at your age. Here's the
spoon I stirred the cake wid&mdash;have a lick o' that.
It'll mebbe help ye."</p>

<p>I licked pensively at the big wooden spoon,
and felt strangely soothed. My admiration for
Mary Ellen increased.</p>

<p>As I slowly climbed the stairs for bed, visions
of Jane hovered in the darkness above me&mdash;airy
rainbows, with Jane's laughing face peering between
the bars of pink and gold. I had never
known a little girl before, and Jane embodied
all things frail and exquisite.</p>

<p>When I entered our room Angel was sitting
on the side of the bed, pulling his shirt over his
head. The Seraph already slept in his place next
the wall.</p>

<p>I stood before Angel with folded arms.</p>

<p>"Hm," he muttered crossly, "you've been lickin'
batter! It's on the end of your nose. Why
didn't you get me something?"</p>

<p>"There was nothing but dough," I explained,
"and one batter spoon. And&mdash;and&mdash;I say,
Angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" asked my elder tersely.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm in love something awful. It hurts.
It's like this&mdash;" I hurried on&mdash;"You feel like
you'd a furnace blazing in you, an' then you turn
cold jus' as if you'd shrivel up, but you <i>never</i>,
<i>never</i>, forget, an'&mdash;It's made a 'normous difference
in my life, Angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>I got no further. Angel had thrown himself
backward on the bed and, kicking his bare legs
in the air, broke into peals of delighted laughter.</p>

<p>"It's that yellow-faced little Jenny!" he gurgled,
"Oh, holy smoke!"</p>

<p>His brutal mirth was short-lived. Mrs. Handsomebody
appeared in the doorway, her face genuinely
shocked at the sight that met her austere
eyes.</p>

<p>At this hour&mdash;such actions&mdash;was her house to
be turned into Bedlam?&mdash;such indecent display
of limbs&mdash;she was sick with shame for Angel&mdash;would
discuss his conduct further, with him, tomorrow.</p>

<p>She waited while I undressed and stood over
us while we said our prayers at the side of the
bed, at last extinguishing the light with a final
admonition to be silent.</p>

<p>I was bitterly disappointed in Angel. It was
the first time he had failed me utterly. I put
my arms around the sleeping Seraph and cried
myself to sleep.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>We were awakened by the sonorous music of
the Cathedral chimes. It was Sunday. That
meant stiff white Eton collars, and texts gabbled
between mouthfuls of porridge; and, later, our
three small bodies arrayed in short surplices, and
the long service in the Cathedral. The Seraph
was the very smallest boy in the choir. I think
he was only tolerated there through Margery's
intervention, because it would have broken his
loyal little heart to be separated from Angel and
me. He was highly ornamental too, as he collected
the choir offertory in a little velvet bag,
his tiny surplice jauntily bobbing, and the back of
his neck, as an old lady once said, was more touching
than the sermon.</p>

<p>Angel had a voice like a flute.</p>

<p>Beyond the tall choir stalls I could catch fleeting
glimpses of Jane's little face beneath her
daisied hat, looking on the same prayer-book with
Margery. I swelled my chest beneath my surplice
and chanted my very loudest in the hope that
Jane might hear me. "O ye Showers and Dew,
bless ye the Lord: praise him, and magnify him
for ever."</p>

<p>Her dreamy blue eyes peered over the edge of
the book, the daisies on her hat nodded; she
smiled; I smiled ecstatically back at her; and so
two childish hearts stemmed the flood of praise
that rose above the old grey pillars.</p>

<p>At dinner, over his bread pudding, The Seraph
murmured in a throaty voice&mdash;"When you is in
love, first you burns yike a furnace, an' en you
shwivel up wiv the cold. It's a vewy bad fing to
be in love."</p>

<p>I threw Angel a bitter look. This was his
doing. So, contemptuously, had he treated my
confidence, made as man to man. To tell the irresponsible
Seraph of all people!</p>

<p>"What's that, Alexander?" questioned Mrs.
Handsomebody, sharply.</p>

<p>"It's love," replied The Seraph, meekly, "you
catch it off a girl. John's got it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody sank back in her chair
with a groan.</p>

<p>"Alexander," she said it solemnly, "I <i>tremble</i>
for your future. You are not the boy your father
was. I tremble for you."</p>

<p>"John," she continued, turning to me, "you will
come into the parlour with me. I wish to have
a talk with you. David and Alexander, you may
amuse yourselves with one of my bound volumes
of 'The Quiver.'"</p>

<p>I followed her with burning cheeks into the
stiff apartment where not only her eye was riveted
upon me, but every glittering eye of every stuffed
bird, to say nothing of the pale fixed gaze of Mr.
Handsomebody.</p>

<p>Needless to recall the lecture I received, the
probing into my reluctant heart, the admonition
which I could not heed for my fearful watching
of that hard grey face.</p>

<p>But, at last, it was over. I slipped into the
hall, closing the door softly behind me, and
listened. Silence abounded. On tiptoe I made
my way to the kitchen. It was clean and empty.
I noiselessly opened the back door. On the doorstep
sat The Seraph busily engaged with a caterpillar.</p>

<p>"Where's Angel?" I demanded curtly.</p>

<p>"I fink," breathed The Seraph, stroking the
caterpillar the wrong way, and then looking at
his fingers, "I fink that he's witin' to father to
tell on you. So there!"</p>

<p>I waited to hear no more. Casting my care
behind me I sped lightly along the passage between
the houses, crossed the Bishop's lawn, and
sought Jane in the garden.</p>

<p>There I stood a moment, dazzled, by the
golden August sunshine, the iridescent spray of
the fountain, and the brilliant colours of the
hollyhocks beside the wall.</p>

<p>I saw Jane there, and my heart swelled with
disappointment and rage&mdash;for she was not alone!</p>

<p>Too late I repented my confidence to Angel;
I might have known that he would never let
the grass grow under his feet till he had tasted
this new excitement. Well, he had not let the
grass grow.</p>

<p>Jane, I remember, had on a pale blue sash,
and a fluffy white frock, beneath the frills of
which, her slender black silk legs moved airily.
By her side sauntered the traitorous Angel, his
head bent toward her tenderly, and, most
sickening of all, pushing before him, with an
air of proprietorship, the perambulator containing
the doll, Dorothea. Jane was simpering up
at him in a way she had never looked at me.</p>

<p>I saw at a glance that all was over, yet I was
not to be cast aside thus lightly. I strode across
the garden, and, pushing myself between them,
I laid my hand masterfully on the handle of the
"pram," beside Angel's. Neither of them uttered
a word. So the three of us walked for
a space in tense silence.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Angel began to hammer my
hand with his fist.</p>

<p>"You let go of that!" he snarled. "Ge&mdash;tout
of here!"</p>

<p>"I won't!" I roared tragically. "She said I
was the fa-ather of it!"</p>

<p>"She did not!" yelled Angel. "I'm the
father!"</p>

<p>Jenny glanced fearfully at the windows of the
Bishop's house. All was silent there. Then,
with a scornful little kick at me, she said&mdash;"Go
'way, you nasty boy! <i>I</i> don't want you. I only
like Angel."</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. I hung
my head, and, with a sob in my throat, turned
away. I could hear them whispering behind
me.</p>

<p>Before I reached our own yard Angel came
running after me.</p>

<p>"Tell you what I'll do, John," he said, as he
came abreast, "tell you what I'll do&mdash;I'll fight you
for her. Like knights of old, you know. We
could go down to the coal cellar, and have a
reg'lar tourney. It'd be bully fun. We could
have pokers for lances. Say, will you?"</p>

<p>I was not in a fighting mood, but I had never
refused a challenge, and, somehow, the thought
of bloodshed eased my pain a little. So, half-reluctantly,
I followed him, as he eagerly led the
way to the coal cellar.</p>

<p>Even on this August day it was cold down
there. Long cobwebs trailed, spectre-like from
the beams, and a faint squeaking of young mice
could be heard in the walls.</p>

<p>We searched among the d&eacute;bris of years for
suitable weapons. Finally, brandishing pokers,
and with two rusty boiler lids for shields, we
faced each other, uttering our respective battle
cries in muffled tones. Angel had put a battered
coal scuttle over his head for a helmet; and,
through a break in it, I could see his dark eyes
gleaming threateningly.</p>

<p>With ring of shield we clashed together. I
delivered&mdash;and received&mdash;stunning blows. Dust,
long undisturbed, rose, and blinded us.</p>

<p>How many a gallant fray has been broken up
by a screaming woman! Now Mary Ellen, true
to the perversity of her sex, rushed in to separate
us.</p>

<p>"Oh, losh! I never seen the beat o' ye!" she
cried. "Ye've scairt me out av a year's growth!
Sure the missus'll put a tin ear on ye, if she catches
ye in the cellar in yer collars an' all!" Imperiously
she disarmed us, and, without ceremony, we
were hustled up the dark stairs to the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>"It was a tournament, Mary Ellen, about a
lady," I explained, with as much dignity as I
could muster, "you shouldn't have interrupted."</p>

<p>"There ain't a lady livin' that's worth messin'
up yer clane clothes for," said Mary Ellen,
sternly. "Lord! To see the cinders in yer hair,
an' the soot in yer ears&mdash;it does bate all&mdash;" As
she talked, she scrubbed us vehemently with a
washcloth.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" moaned Angel, "oh, Mary El-len,
you're <i>hurting</i> me! That's my so-ore spot,
eeeoow!"</p>

<p>"Well, Master Angel," said Mary Ellen, "I
don't want to hurt ye, but it do make me heart-sick
to see ye bashin' aitch other wid pokers for
the sake av a bit girl that's not worth a tinker's
curse to ye! Now thin&mdash;here's a piece of cowld
puddin' to each av ye&mdash;sit on the durestep where
the missus won't see ye, an' git outside av it."</p>

<p>In a chastened mood we sat outside the back
door and ate our pudding. It was cold, clammy,
very sweet, and deliciously satisfying.</p>

<p>To our right the wall excluded any glimpse of
the Bishop's garden, and beyond loomed the
Cathedral, with two grey pigeons circling about
its spire.</p>

<p>I yearned to know what was going on beyond
the wall. I could not help fancying that Jane,
touched by remorse, was weeping by the fountain
for me, and me only. Angel spoke.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;" he hunched his shoulders mischievously&mdash;"let's
go 'round and see what she's
doin' all alone, eh?"</p>

<p>I leaped to the proposal. I had an insatiable desire to hear her speak once more, if it were
only to taunt me.</p>

<p>We made the passage stealthily; all the world
seemed drowsing on that hazy Sunday afternoon.
The blinds in the Bishop's study were drawn.
Little did he guess the life his great-niece led!</p>

<p>The grass was like moist velvet beneath our
feet. A pair of sparrows were quarrelling over
their bath at the fountain rim. We heard a low
murmur of voices. A glint of Jane's white frock
could be seen behind a guelder rose near the
fountain. We crept up behind and peered
through the foliage.</p>

<p>There on a garden bench sat Jane, and there,
clasped in her slim white arms was&mdash;The Seraph!
The wretched Dorothea lay, face downward, on
the grass at their feet.</p>

<p>We strained our ears to hear what was being
said. Jane spoke in that silvery voice of hers:</p>

<p>"Say some more drefful things, Seraph. I jus'
love to hear you."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; then, The
Seraph said in his blandest tone, the one word&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blood!"</p>

<p>Jane gave a tiny, ecstatic shriek.</p>

<p>"Oh, go on!" she begged, "say more."</p>

<p>"Blood," repeated The Seraph, firmly, "Hot
blood&mdash;told blood&mdash;wed blood&mdash;thick blood&mdash;thin
blood&mdash;bad blood."</p>

<p>Again Jane squealed in fearful pleasure.</p>

<p>"Go on," she urged. "Worser."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, The Seraph rapped out, without
more ado, "Tiger blood&mdash;ephelant blood&mdash;caterpillar
blood&mdash;ole witch blood"&mdash;then, after
a pause, that the horror of it might sink deep in&mdash;"Baby
blood!"</p>

<p>Angel and I gave each other a look of enlightenment.
It was gore then, that this delicately
nurtured young person craved, good red
gore, and plenty of it! Well&mdash;enough&mdash;we were
free. Wait! What was she saying?</p>

<p>"I <i>hate</i> those other boys, Seraph, darling.
Let's jus' you and me play together always. And
you should be Dorothea's <i>father</i>, and Dorothea
should want to paddle in the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Away! Away! With sardonic laughter, we
sped along the pebbled drive, nor stopped until
we reached our own domain.</p>

<p>Then in the planked back yard, we sat on our
steps, with a volume of "The Quiver" on our
knees, in case Mrs. Handsomebody should invade
our privacy, and played a rollicking game of
pirates. And when any of the fair sex fell into
our hands we were none too gentle with them.</p>

<p>"Chuck 'em overboard, lieutenant!" was Captain
Angel's way of dealing with the case.</p>

<p>Just as the Cathedral clock struck five, The
Seraph swaggered up. He stopped before us,
hands deep in pockets.</p>

<p>"Well," said Angel, eyeing him resentfully,
"you'll make a nice bishop, you will, usin' the
language we heard a bit ago!"</p>

<p>"Maybe I shan't have time to be a bishop, after
all," replied The Seraph, condescendingly.
"You see I'm goin' to mawy Jane. It'll keep me
vewy busy."</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch3">Chapter III: Explorers of the
Dawn</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Fast on the wing&egrave;d heels of Love came our discovery
of the Dawn. Of course we had known
all along that there was a sunrise&mdash;a mechanical
sort of affair that started things going like clockwork.
But Dawn was a bird of another feather.</p>

<p>If we had had our parents with us they would
have, in all likelihood, unfolded the mystery of
it in some bedtime visit; but Mrs. Handsomebody,
if she ever thought about the Dawn at all,
probably looked on it with suspicion, and some
disfavour, as a weak, feeble thing&mdash;a nebulous
period fit neither for honest folk nor cutthroats.</p>

<p>So it came about that we heard of it from our
good friend the Bishop. Mrs. Handsomebody
had given a grudging permission for us to take
tea with him. In hot weather her voice and eyes
always seemed frostier than usual. The closely
shut windows and drawn blinds made the house
a prison, and the glare of the planked back yard
was even more intolerable. Therefore, when
Rawlins, the Bishop's butler, told us that we were
to have tea in the garden, it was hard for us to
remember Mrs. Handsomebody's injunction to
walk sedately and to bear in mind that our host
was a bishop.</p>

<p>But, as we crossed the cool lawn, our spirits,
which had drooped all day, like flags at half-mast,
rose, and fluttered in the summer breeze,
and we could not resist a caper or two as we approached
the tea-table.</p>

<p>The Bishop did not even see us. His fine
grave face was buried in a book he had on his
knees, and his gaitered legs were bent so that he
toed in.</p>

<p>When we drew up before him, Angel and I in
stiff Eton collars and The Seraph fresh as a daisy,
in a clean white sailor blouse, he raised his eyes
and gave us a vague smile, and a wave of the
hand toward three low wicker chairs. We were
not a bit abashed by this reception, for we knew
the Bishop's ways, and it was joy enough that
we were safe in his garden staring up at the blue
sky through flickering leaves, and listening to the
splash of the little fountain that lived in the middle
of the cool grass plot.</p>

<p>Surely, I thought, there never was such another
garden&mdash;never another with such a rosy red
brick wall, half-hidden by hollyhocks and larkspur&mdash;such springy, tender grass&mdash;such a great
guardian Cathedral, that towered above and
threw its deep beneficent shade! Here the timorous
Cathedral pigeons strutted unafraid, and
dipped their heads to drink of the fountain, raising
them Heavenward, as they swallowed&mdash;thanking
God, so the Bishop said, for its refreshment.</p>

<p>It was hard to believe that next door, beyond
the wall, lay Mrs. Handsomebody's planked back
yard. Yet even at that moment I could see the
tall, narrow house, and fancied that a blind
moved as Mrs. Handsomebody peered down into
the Bishop's garden to see how we behaved.</p>

<p>Rawlins brought a tray and set it on the wicker
table beside the Bishop's elbow. We discovered
a silver muffin dish, a plate of cakes, and a glass
pot of honey, to say nothing of the tea.</p>

<p>Still the Bishop kept his gaze buried in his
book, marking his progress with a blade of grass.
Rawlins stole away without speaking and we three
were left alone to stare in mute desire at the tea
things. A bee was buzzing noisily about the
honey jar. It was The Seraph who spoke at last,
his hands clasped across his stomach.</p>

<p>"Bishop," he said, politely, but firmly. "I
would yike a little nushment."</p>

<p>"Bless me!" cried the Bishop. "Wherever are
my manners?" And he closed the book sharply
on the grass blade, and dropped it under the table.
"John, will you pour tea for us?"</p>

<p>We finished the muffins and cake, all talking
with our mouths full, in the most sociable and
sensible way; and, after the honey pot was almost
empty, we made the bee a prisoner in it, so that,
like that Duke of Clarence, who was drowned in
a butt of Malmsey, he got enough of what he
liked at last.</p>

<p>I think it was Angel who put the question that
was to lead to so much that was exciting and
mysterious.</p>

<p>He said, leaning against the Bishop's shoulder:
"What do you think is the most beautiful thing
in the world, Bishop?"</p>

<p>Our friend had The Seraph between his knees,
and was gazing at the back of his head. "Well,"
he replied, "since you ask me seriously, I should
say this little curl on The Seraph's nape."</p>

<p>The Seraph felt for it.</p>

<p>"I yike it," he said, "but I yike my wart better."</p>

<p>"Good gracious," exclaimed the Bishop.
"Don't tell me <i>you've</i> a wart!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a weal one," chuckled The Seraph. "It's
little, but it's gwowing. I fink some day it'll be
as big as the one on Mrs. Handsomebody's chin.
<i>It can wiggle.</i>"</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" said the Bishop, rather
hastily. "And where do you suppose you got
it?"</p>

<p>The Seraph smiled mischievously. "I fink I
got it off a toad we had. He was an awful dear
ole toad, but he died, 'cos we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, don't bother about the old toad,
Seraph!" put in Angel hastily, feeling, as I did,
that the manner of the toad's demise was best
left to conjecture. "We want to hear about the
most beautiful thing in the world. Please tell
it, Bishop!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;since you corner me," said the Bishop,
his eyes on the larkspur, "I should say it is the
wing of that pale blue butterfly, hovering above
those deep blue flowers."</p>

<p>Angel's face fell. "Oh, I didn't mean a little
thing like that," he said. "I meant a 'normous,
wonderful thing. Something that you couldn't
<i>ever</i> forget."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you will have it," said the Bishop,
"come close and I'll whisper." Instantly three
heads hedged him in, and he said in a sonorous
undertone&mdash;"<i>It's the Dawn.</i>"</p>

<p>"The Dawn!" We three repeated the magic
words on the same note of secrecy. "But what is
it like? How can we get to it? Is it like the
sunset?"</p>

<p>"I won't explain a bit of it," he replied.
"You've got to seek it out for yourselves. It's
a pity, though, you can't see it first in the country."</p>

<p>"Must we get up in the dark?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think your tallest attic window faces
the east. You must steal up there while it's still
grey daylight. Have the windows open so that
you can hear and smell, as well as see it. But
I'm afraid the dear Seraph's too little."</p>

<p>"Not me," asserted The Seraph, stoutly.
"I'm stwong as two ephelants."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be frightened when you hear its
wings," said the Bishop, "nor be abashed at the
splendour of it, for it was designed for just such
little fellows as you. You will come and tell me
then what happens, won't you? I shall probably
never waken early enough to see it again."...</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Though we played games after this, and the
Bishop made a very satisfactory lion prowling
about in a jungle of wicker chairs and table legs,
we none of us quite lost sight of the adventure
in store for us. Somewhere in the back of our
heads lurked the thought of the Dawn with its
suggestion of splendid mystery.</p>

<p>We were no sooner at home again than we set
about discussing ways and means.</p>

<p>"The chief thing," said Angel, "is to waken
about four. We have no alarm clock, so I s'pose
we'll just have to take turns in keeping watch all
night. The hall clock strikes, so we can watch
hour about."</p>

<p>"I'll take first watch!" put in The Seraph,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"You'll take just what's given to you, and no
questions, young man," said Angel, out of the
side of his mouth, and The Seraph subsided,
crushed.</p>

<p>Came bedtime at last, and the three of us in
the big four-poster; the door shut upon the world
of Mrs. Handsomebody, and the windows firmly
barred against burglars and night air.</p>

<p>Angel announced: "First watch for me!
You go right to sleep, John, and I'll wake you
when the clock strikes ten. Then you'll feel nice
and fresh for your watch."</p>

<p>But I wasn't at all sleepy and we lay in the
dusk and talked till the familiar harsh voice of
the hall clock rasped out nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"You go to sleep, please John," whispered
Angel in a drowsy voice, "and I'll watch till ten."</p>

<p>I felt drowsy too, so I put my arm about the
slumbering Seraph and soon fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed to me but a moment when Angel
roused me. I know I had barely settled down
to an enjoyable dream in which I was the only
customer in an ice-cream parlour, where there
were seven waitresses, each one obsequiously
proffering a different flavour.</p>

<p>"Second watch on deck!" whispered Angel,
hoarsely&mdash;"and look lively!"</p>

<p>"But I'd only just put my spoon in the strawberry
ice," I moaned. "Can't be ten minutes yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say," complained Angel, "don't you
s'pose I know when the old clock strikes ten?
You've been sleepin' like a drunken pirate and
no mistake. Must be near eleven by now."</p>

<p>"I'll just see for myself," I declared. "I'll go
and look at the schoolroom clock." And I began
to scramble over him.</p>

<p>"You will not then&mdash;" muttered Angel, clutching
me. "I shan't let you!"</p>

<p>"You won't, eh? If it's really ten you needn't
care, need you!"</p>

<p>"Course it's ten&mdash;It's nearer eleven, but you're
going to do what I say."</p>

<p>At that we came to grips and fought and
floundered till the bed rocked, and the poor little
Seraph clung to his pillow as a shipwrecked sailor
to a raft in a stormy sea. Exhaustion alone
made us stop for breath; still we clung desperately
to each other, our small bodies pressed hotly
together, Angel's nose flattened against my ear.
The Seraph snuggled up to us. "Just you wait"&mdash;breathed
Angel&mdash;his hands tightened on me,
then relaxed&mdash;his legs twitched&mdash;"Strawberry or
pineapple, sir?" came the dulcet tones of the waitress.
I was in my ice-cream parlour again!
Seven flavours were laid before me. I fell to,
for I was hot and thirsty.</p>

<p>I was disturbed by The Seraph, singing his
morning song. It was a tuneless drone, yet not
unmusical. Always the first to open his eyes in
the morning, he began his day with a sort of
Saga of his exploits of the day before, usually
meaningless to us but fraught with colour from
his own peculiar sphere. At last he laughed outright&mdash;a
Jovian laugh&mdash;at some remembered
prank&mdash;and I rubbed my eyes and came to full
consciousness. The sun was slanting through
the shutters. Where, oh where, was the Dawn?</p>

<p>I turned to look at Angel. He was staring
at the slanting beam and swearing softly, as he
well knew how.</p>

<p>"We'll simply have to try again"&mdash;I said.
"But however are we going to put in today?"</p>

<p>The problem solved itself as all problems will
and the day passed, following the usual landmarks
of porridge, arithmetic, spelling, scoldings,
mutton, a walk with our governess, bread and
butter, prayers, and the (for once, longed for!)
<i>bed</i>.</p>

<p>That night we decided to lie awake together;
passing the time with stories, and speculation
about the mystery so soon to be explored by us.
I told the first story, a long-drawn adventure of
shipwreck, mutiny and coral Caves, with a fair
sprinkling of skeletons to keep us broad awake.</p>

<p>"It was a first-rate tale," sighed Angel, contentedly,
when I had done, "an' you told it
awfully well, John. If you like you may just
tell another 'stead o' me. Or The Seraph can
tell one. Go ahead, Seraph, and make up the
best story you know how."</p>

<p>The Seraph, important, but sleepy, climbed
over me, so that he might be in the middle, and
then began, in a husky little voice:</p>

<p>"Once upon a time there was fwee bwothers, all
vwey nice, but the youngest was the bwavest an'
stwongest of the fwee. He was as stwong as two
bulls, an' he'd kill a dwagon before bweakfast, an'
never be cocky about it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Angel and I groaned in unison. We could not
tolerate this sort of self-adulation from our junior.
"Don't be such a little beast"&mdash;we admonished,
and covered his head with a pillow. The Seraph
was wont to accept such discipline, at our hands,
philosophically, with no unseemly outcries or
struggles; as a matter of fact, when we uncovered
his head, we could tell by his even, reposeful
breathing that he was fast asleep. It was too
dark to see his face, but I could imagine his complacent
smile.</p>

<p>The night sped quickly after that. There was
some desultory talk; then Angel, too, slept; I resolved
to keep the watch alone. I heard the
sound of footsteps in the street below, echoing,
with a lonely sound; the rattle of a loose shutter
in a sudden gust of wind; then, dead silence,
followed after an interval by the scampering, and
angry squeak of mice in the wall....</p>

<p>The mice disturbed me again. There was a
shattering of loose plaster; and suddenly opening
my eyes, I saw the ghost of grey daylight stealing
underneath the blind. The time had come!</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Silently the three of us stole up the uncarpeted
attic stair. It was unknown territory to us, having
been forbidden from the first by Mrs. Handsomebody,
and all we had ever seen from the hall
below was a cramped passage, guarded by three
closed doors. Time and time again we had been
tempted to explore it, but there was a sinister
aloofness about it that had hitherto repelled us.
Now, however, it had become but a pathway to
the Dawn, and, as we clutched the bannisters, we
imagined ourselves three pilgrims fearfully climbing
toward light and beauty.</p>

<p>Angel stood first at the top. Gently he tried
two doors in succession, which were locked. The
third gave, harshly&mdash;it seemed to me, grudgingly.</p>

<p>The Seraph and I pressed close behind Angel,
glad of the warm contact of each other's bodies.</p>

<p>In the large attic room, the air was stifling, and
the sloping roof, from which dim cobwebs were
draped, seemed to press toward the dark shapes
of discarded furniture as though to guard some
fearful secret. It took all our courage to grope
our way to the low casement, and it was a struggle
to dislodge the rusty bolt, and press the window
out on its unused hinges. It creaked so loudly
that we held our breath for a moment, but we
drew it again with a sharp sensation of relief, as
thirsty young animals drink, for fresh night air,
sweet, stinging to the nostrils, had surged in upon
us, sweeping away fear, and loneliness, and the
hot depression of the attic room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody's house was tall, and we
could look down upon many roofs and chimneys.
They huddled together in the soft grey light as
though waiting for some great happening which
they expected, but did not understand. They
wore an air of expectancy and humility. Little
low-roofed out-houses pressed close to high walls
for shelter, and a frosty white skylight stared up-ward
fearfully.</p>

<p>"Is this the Dawn?" came from The Seraph,
in a tiny voice.</p>

<p>"Only the beginning of it," I whispered back.
"There's two stars left over from the night&mdash;see!
that big blue one in the east, and the little white
one just above the cobbler's chimney."</p>

<p>"Will they be afwaid of the Dawn, when it
comes?"</p>

<p>"Rather. I shouldn't be surprised if the big
fellow bolted right across the sky, and the little
one will p'raps fall down the cobbler's chimney
into his work-room."</p>

<p>The Seraph was enchanted. "Then the
cobbler'll sew him wight up in the sole of a shoe,
an' the boy who wears the shoe will twinkle when
he wuns, won't he? Oh, it's coming now! I
hear it. I'm afwaid."</p>

<p>"That's not the Dawn," said Angel, "that's the
night flying away."</p>

<p>It was true that there came to us then a rushing
sound, as of strong wings; our hair was lifted from
our hot foreheads; and the casement rattled on
its hinges.</p>

<p>This wind, that came from the wings of night,
was sharp with the fragrance of heather and the
sea. One fancied how it would surge through the
dim aisles of cathedral-like forests, ruffling the
plumage of drowsy birds, stirring the surface of
some dark pool, where the trout still slept, and
making sibilant music among the drooping reeds.</p>

<p>The sky had now become delicately luminous,
and a streak of saffron showed above the farthest
roofs; a flock of little clouds huddled together
above this, like timorous sheep at graze. The
white star hung just above the cobbler's chimney,
dangerously near, it seemed to us, who watched.</p>

<p>There were only two of us at the window now,
for Angel had stolen away to explore every corner
of the new environment, as was his custom. I
could hear the soft opening and shutting of bureau
drawers, and once, a grunting and straining, as of
one engaged in severe manual labour.</p>

<p>A low whistle drew me to his side.</p>

<p>"What's up?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Got this little old trunk open at last," he
muttered, "full of women's junk. Funny stuff.
Look."</p>

<p>Our heads touched as we bent curiously over
the contents. It was a dingy and insignificant box
on the outside, but it was lined with a gaily
coloured paper, on which nosegays of spring
flowers bent beneath the weight of silver butterflies,
and sad-eyed cockatoos. The trays were
full, as Angel had said, of women's things;
delicate, ruffly frocks of pink and lilac; and undergarments
edged with yellowing lace. A sweet
scent rose from them, as of some gentle presence
that strove to reach the light and air once more.
A pair of little white kid slippers looked as though
they longed to twinkle in and out beneath a soft
silk skirt. Angel's mischievous brown hands
dived among the light folds, discovering opera
glasses,&mdash;(treasures to be secured if possible,
against some future South Sea expedition), an inlaid
box of old-fashioned trinkets, a coral necklace,
gold-tasselled earrings, and a brooch of
tortured locks of hair.</p>

<p>Angel's eyes were dancing above a gauze fan
held coquettishly against his mouth of an impudent
boy, but I gave no heed to him; I was busy with a
velvet work-box that promised a solution of the
mystery&mdash;for hidden away with thimble and
scissors as one would secrete a treasure, was a fat
little book, "The Mysteries of Udolpho."
Some one had drawn on the fly leaf, very beautifully,
I thought, a ribbed sea-shell, and on it had
printed the words, "Lucy from Charles;" and on
a scroll beneath the shell, in microscopic characters&mdash;"Bide
the Time!"</p>

<p>My brother was looking over my shoulder now.
We were filled with conjecture.</p>

<p>"Lucy," said Angel, "owned all this stuff, and
Charles was her lover, of course. But who was
she? Mrs. Handsomebody never had a daughter,
I know, and if she had she'd never have allowed
her to wear these things. Look how she jaws
when Mary Ellen spends her wage on finery. I'll
bet Lucy was a beauty. And she's dead too, you
can bet, and Charles was her lover, and likely he's
dead too. 'Bide the time,' eh? You see they're
waitin' around yet&mdash;<i>somewheres</i>. Isn't it queer?"</p>

<p>The Seraph's voice came from the window in
a sort of chant:</p>

<p>"The little white star has fallen down the
cobbler's chimney!</p>

<p>"It has fallen down, and the cobbler is sewing
it into a shoe!</p>

<p>"A milkman is wunning down the stweet!</p>

<p>"Tell you what," whispered Angel, "I'll show
you what Lucy was like&mdash;just a little. I'll make
a picture of her."</p>

<p>The space between two tall chests of drawers
formed a sort of alcove in which stood a pier
glass, whose tarnished frame was draped in
white net. Before it Angel drew (without much
caution) a high-backed chair, and on it he began
his picture.</p>

<p>Over the seat and almost touching the floor, he
draped a frilled petticoat, and against the back
of the chair (with a foundation of formidable
stays for support) he hung a garment, which,
even then, he seemed to know for a camisole.
Over all he laid a charming lilac silk gown, and
under the hem in the most natural attitude peeped
the little party slippers. A small lace and velvet
bonnet with streamers was hung at the apex of
the creation, and in her lap (for the time has
come to use the feminine pronoun) he spread
the gauzy fan. He hung over her tenderly, as
an artist over his subject&mdash;each fold must be in
place&mdash;the empty sleeves curved just so&mdash;one
fancied a rounded chin beneath the velvet
streamers, so artfully was it adjusted. Her reflection
in the pier glass was superb!</p>

<p>"It is here!" chanted The Seraph. "Evwy bit
of evwy fing is shinin'! Oh, Angel an' John,
<i>please</i> look!"</p>

<p>We flew to the window and leaned across the
sill.</p>

<p>It was a happy world that morning, glowing
in the sweetest dawn that ever broke over roofs
and chimney pots. The earth sang as she danced
her dewy way among the paling stars. The little
grey clouds blushed pink against the azure sky.
Blossoming boughs of peach and apricot hung
over the gates of heaven, and rosy spirals curled
upward from two chimneys. Pink-footed
pigeons strutted, rooketty-cooing along the roofs.
They nodded their heads as though to affirm
the consummation of a miracle. "It is so&mdash;"
they seemed to say&mdash;"It is indeed so&mdash;" One
of them hopped upon the cobbler's chimney, peering
earnestly into its depths. "It sees the star!"
shouted The Seraph. "It sees the star and nods
to it. 'I am higher now than you'&mdash;it says!"</p>

<p>Something&mdash;was it a breath? a sigh?&mdash;made
me look back into the attic where Lucy's clothes
clung to the high-backed chair, like flower petals
blown against a wall. The pier-glass had
caught all the glory of the morning and was releasing
it in quivering spears of light that dazzled me for a moment; I rubbed my eyes, and
stared, and shook a little, for in the midst of
all this splendour I saw Lucy! No pallid, rigid
ghost, but something warm, eager with life,
spreading the folds of the lilac gown like a butterfly
warming its new wings in the strength of
the sun.</p>

<p>Her bosom rose and fell quickly, her eyes were
fixed on me with a beseeching look, it seemed. I
drew nearer&mdash;near enough to smell the faint perfume
of her, and I saw then that she was not
looking at me, but at the fat little book of "The
Mysteries of Udolpho" which I still held in my
hands. The book that Charles had given her!
"Bide the time!" he had written, but she could
bide the time no longer.</p>

<p>Proud as any knight before his lady, I strode
forward, and pressed the book into her hands&mdash;saw
her slender fingers curl around it&mdash;heard her
little gasp of joy. I should not have been at all
surprised had the door opened and Charles
walked in.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the door <i>did</i> open and&mdash;Mrs.
Handsomebody walked in.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>She gave a sort of gurgling cry, as though she
were being strangled. Angel and The Seraph
faced about to look at her in consternation, their
hair wild in the wind, and the rising sun making
an aureole about them. The four of us stared
at each other in silence for a space, while the
attic-room, with its cobwebs reeled&mdash;the sun rose,
and sank, like a floundering ship, and Mrs. Handsomebody
resembling, in my fancy, a hungry
spider, in curl papers, considered which victim
was ripest for slaughter.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;and you&mdash;and you&mdash;" she gobbled.
"Oh, to think of it! No place safe! What you
need is a <i>strong</i> man. <i>We</i> shall see! The very
windows&mdash;burst from their bolts!" She
slammed the casement and secured it, Angel and
The Seraph darting from her path.</p>

<p>"Even a dead woman's clothes&mdash;to make a
scarecrow of!" She pounced&mdash;I hid my face
while she did it, but I heard a sinister rustling
and the snap of a trunk lid. It was over.
"Bide the time."</p>

<p>Ignominiously she herded us down the stairs;
The Seraph making only one step at a time, led
the way. Far down the drab vista of the back
stairs that ended in the scullery, Mary Ellen's
red, round face was seen for a moment, like a
second rising sun, but vanished as suddenly as it
had appeared, at a shout from Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>We were in the schoolroom now, placed before
her in a row, as was her wont in times of retribution.
Seated behind her desk she wore her
purple dressing gown with magisterial dignity;
the wart upon her chin quivered as she prepared
to speak.</p>

<p>"Now, David," she said, rapping Angel
smartly on the head, "can you say anything
in explanation of this outrage upon my property?
Hold your head up and toe out, please."</p>

<p>Angel looked at his hands. "Nuffin' to explain,"
he said sulkily. "Just went an' did it."</p>

<p>"Oh I thought so," said our governess. "It
was just one of these seemingly irresistible impulses
that have so often proved disastrous for all
concerned. If your father knew&mdash;" she bit off
the words as though they had a pleasant, if acrid
taste&mdash;"if your poor father knew of your criminal
proclivities, he would be a <i>crushed</i> man. A
<i>crushed man</i>."</p>

<p>The Seraph was staring at her chin.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;"I have one too," he said gently.</p>

<p>"One <i>what</i>?" Her tone should have warned
him. "One wart," he went on, with easy
modesty. "It's just a little one. It can't wiggle&mdash;like
yours&mdash;but it's gwowing nicely.
Would you care to see it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody affected not to hear him.
She stared sombrely at Angel and me, but I believe
The Seraph sealed our fate, for, after a
moment's deliberation, she said curtly; "I shall
have to beat you for this."</p>

<p>She gave us six apiece, and I could not help
noticing that, though The Seraph was the youngest
and tenderest, his six were the most stinging.</p>

<p>When we had been sent to our bedroom to
say our prayers, and change our pitifully inadequate
night clothes for day things, I put the
question that was burning in my mind.</p>

<p>"Did either of you see <i>her</i>?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Lucy, sitting there in the chair."</p>

<p>Angel's brown eyes were blank.</p>

<p>"I saw her <i>clothes</i>. What sickens me is that
the dragon took that spy-glass. You see if I
don't get it yet." (Mrs. Handsomebody was
"the dragon" in our vernacular.)</p>

"Did <i>you</i> see her, Seraph?"

<p>The Seraph was sitting on the floor, his head
on his knees. He raised a tear-flushed face.</p>

<p>"I'm 'most too cwushed to wemember," he
said, huskily. "But I <i>fink</i> Lucy was fat. It's
a vewy bad fing to be fat, 'cos the cane hurts
worser."</p>

<p>I turned from such infantile imbecility to the
exhilarating reflection that I was the only one to
whom Lucy had shown herself&mdash;her chosen
knight!</p>

<p>I was burning to do her service, yet the passage
that led to the attic stronghold was well guarded.
Two days had passed before I made the attempt.
I had been sent upstairs from the tea-table to
wash my hands&mdash;though they were only comfortably
soiled&mdash;and after I had dipped them in
a basin of water that had done service for both
Angel and The Seraph, I gave them a good rub
on my trouser legs, as I tip-toed to the foot of
the attic stairs. Cautiously, with fast-beating
heart, I mounted, and tried the door. It was
locked fast. I pressed my eye against the keyhole,
and made out in the gloom the dark shape
of the trunk, sinister, forbidding, inaccessible.
No rustle of lilac silk, no faintest perfume, no
appealing sigh from the gentle Lucy greeted me.
All was dark and quiet. "Bide the time!" Who
knew but that some day I might set her free?</p>

<p>Yet my throat ached as I slowly made my way
back to the table, presented my hands for a rather
sceptical inspection by Mrs. Handsomebody, and
dropped languidly into my seat.</p>

<p>The Seraph gave me a look of sympathy&mdash;even
understanding&mdash;perhaps he had heard me
mount the distant attic stairs; his hearing was
wonderfully acute. He chewed in silence for a
moment and then he made one of those seemingly
irrelevant remarks of his that, somehow, always
set our little world a-rocking.</p>

<p>"One fing about Lucy," he said, "she was always
sweet-tempud."</p>

<p>"Who?" snapped Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"Lucy&mdash;" repeated The Seraph. "Such a
sweet-tempud gell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody leaned over him, and gobbled
and threatened. The Seraph preserved a
remarkable calm, considering that he was the
storm centre. He even raised his small forefinger
before his face and looked at it thoughtfully.
His speculative gaze travelled from it to
Mrs. Handsomebody's chin. I perceived then
that he was comparing warts!</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch4">Chapter IV: A Merry
Interlude</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>My brothers and I were hanging over the gate
that barred our way to the outer world, and singing,
as loudly as we could, considering the pressure
of the top bar on our young stomachs. We
sang to keep warm, for Mrs. Handsomebody had
decreed that no reefers were to be worn till the
first of December. So, though November was
raw, she maintained her discipline and refused
to mollycoddle us.</p>

<p>It was the fifth, and Angel chanted in that
flute-like treble of his, that made passersby turn
and smile at him:</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"Remember, remember the fifth of November,</p>
<p class="i2">Gunpowder, treason and plot&mdash;"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then The Seraph added his little pipe:</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"I see no weason why gunpowder tweason</p>
<p class="i2">Should ever be forgot."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then we shouted it all together.</p>

<p>Our neighbour, Mr. Mortimer Pegg, who had
never forgiven us for our share in the treasure
hunt, came out of his house at that moment, and
drew up before us.</p>

<p>"This noise, you know," he said, in his precise
way, "is affecting my wife's health deleteriously.
She has gone to bed with a migraine."</p>

<p>"Why don't you put him out," suggested The
Seraph.</p>

<p>Mr. Pegg eyed him severely, yet I thought I
perceived a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"It's Guy Fawkes day," I explained. "You
see, it must never be forgot."</p>

<p>"It is a mistake in these enlightened days to
keep up such old animosities," replied our neighbour.
"For all you know I might be his
direct descendant. If you must celebrate his undoing,
better take these three sixpences and make
yourselves ill on lemon fizz, or pink marshmallows,
or vile licorice cigars."</p>

<p>He placed a coin in each outstretched hand,
and, without waiting for thanks, strode briskly
down the street. We gazed after him, knocked
speechless by this great beaker of bounty that
had rolled in upon the flat expanse of our afternoon.
Mr. Pegg, in his shiny top hat and neat
Prince Albert moved away in the ruddy November
sunlight as in a halo of opulence. Never
before had we appreciated the princely turn of his
toes beneath their drab spats, the flash of his
twirled walking-stick. We resolved to keep him
in mind. He was a neighbour worth having.
Angel even suggested certain time-honoured ditties
of boyhood, which, shouted in chorus, would
be almost certain to have a disastrous effect on
a female addicted to migraine.</p>

<p>A deputation, consisting of The Seraph, then
waited on Mrs. Handsomebody, to explain that
our neighbour, Mr. Pegg, having been charmed
by our singing, had presented us each with a
sixpence, with the earnest injunction that the coin
be expended on currant buns at the grocer's. The
Seraph came back triumphant with the necessary
consent.</p>

<p>"We can go," he said, "but we're not to take
a bite till we're back home. It's suppwising
she'd let us do it."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Angel cynically, "she knows
they'll spoil our appetite for tea."</p>

<p>The grocer was a fierce, red-bearded man who
kept his wife in a little wooden stall, where she
took in the constant flow of wealth extorted from
his customers.</p>

<p>We had told The Seraph that she was thus
confined by her gloomy spouse, in order that she
might be fattened for slaughter, and his eyes
were large with pity as he stood on tiptoe to hand
our three sixpences through the little wicket.
The grocer's wife leaned forward to look at him,
her plump underlip, after two futile attempts to
form a chin, subsiding into a large white neck.</p>

<p>The Seraph's look of pity deepened to horror.
"You must be almost weady," he gasped.</p>

<p>"Ready? Ready for what, my little love?"</p>

<p>"Stickin'&mdash;oo, will it hurt vewy much?"</p>

<p>"Bless the child. What <i>does</i> he mean?"</p>

<p>"He's not very well," I explained. "I think
he's delirious."</p>

<p>"That's why we brought him here to get a
cool drink," added Angel, hurriedly, and between
us we led the recreant to the little table in the
rear of the shop where the grocer had set out
three glasses of ginger beer and a plate of mixed
cakes. Five minutes of unalloyed bliss followed
and we were just draining off the last dregs and
cleaning up the crumbs, when a bullet-headed boy
stuck his head in at the door.</p>

<p>"Dorg's 'ere again," he said, laconically.
"Nosin' abaht in the gabbage 'eap."</p>

<p>"Tie a can on 'is tile," said the grocer.</p>

<p>The boy disappeared, and the three of us
pushed back our chairs and followed in his wake,
scenting adventure in the littered yard behind
the shop with its strange odours of bygone fruit
and greens.</p>

<p>The dog, a small, black, Scottish terrier, was
dragging an end of Boulogna sausage from the
garbage heap. The bullet-headed boy winked
at us, selected an empty can from the heap, produced a piece of string from his pocket, and
grasped the terrier by the collar. But only for
a moment. With a rush of concentrated fury
it flew at his legs, gave him a sharp snap, and
darted back to its sausage, with a warning glean
of its eyes in our direction.</p>

<p>"Ow," yelled the boy, doubling up, "'e's bit
me sumpfin' cruel! You see if I daon't brain 'im
for that!"</p>

<p>He snatched up an axe and brandished it.
The terrier dropped its sausage and showed its
little pointed teeth.</p>

<p>We three, with one impulse, flung ourselves
between it and the boy.</p>

<p>"You dare touch that dog," shouted Angel.</p>

<p>"Oo's goin' to stop me, Mister Nosey Parker?"
sneered the boy, with a flourish of his axe.</p>

<p>"I am," said Angel, "'cos it's <i>my</i> dog, see?"
He coolly turned his back on the boy and bent
over the terrier, who came to him cautiously,
sniffing his legs.</p>

<p>"Your dorg!" scoffed the boy, "w'y daon't yer
feed 'im then? 'E's arf starved, 'e is. Yer
ought to be 'ad up fer perwention of cruelty to
hanimals. It's a disgrice."</p>

<p>"We've only owned him a little while," explained
Angel, "and he strayed away. He'll be
jolly glad to get home again&mdash;won't you, Rover?
Give us that bit of string and I'll lead him."</p>

<p>The boy, suddenly friendly, in one of those
swiftly changing moods of boyhood, assisted in
the tying of the string to the little dog's collar,
though he cast a longing look at its stout fringed
tail that was so admirably built to further the
riotous bouncings of an empty tin can.</p>

<p>We led him triumphantly through the shop
into the street, and we trotted in silence for a
space, staring in rapt admiration of the little
black paws that padded along in such a business-like
fashion beside us, the knowingly-pointed
ears, and valiant tail carried at a jaunty angle
above the sturdy hind-quarters.</p>

<p>When we reached our own quiet street we
stopped. The Seraph looked in the bag of buns.</p>

<p>"May I give him mine?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Good boy," said Angel, and The Seraph presented
the little dog with the large currant bun.
We were charmed indeed when he sat up for it
in the most approved trained-animal posture, with
short fore-legs crossed on his plump hairy breast.
How often had we longed for the joyous companionship
of our old four-footed friends, the
comfort of a soft warm tongue on one's cheek,
the sensitive muzzle pressed into one's palm, the
look of loving confidence in the deep brown eyes.</p>

<p>But our governess hated dogs, and we were
expressly forbidden to so much as pat the head
of any stray canine that thrust an inquiring nose
between the bars of her gate. Therefore, it was
with sad foreboding that we watched the bun
disappear. The Scotty held it between his forepaws
and bit off decent mouthfuls, without sign
of greed or haste. By his bearing and by his
shining silver collar we knew that he was, or had
been some one's cherished pet.</p>

<p>The bun had cheered him wonderfully, for,
as we moved homeward, he leaped playfully at
his leash, and catching it in his teeth, worried it
in an abandon of glee.</p>

<p>We made no plans. We had no hopes. We
merely were drawn by habit and necessity to the
place where, we knew, desperate trouble awaited
us. At the gate we halted.</p>

<p>"We might take him into the yard to play for
a little while," I said. "P'raps we could carry
him upstairs wrapped in my coat, and hide him
under the bed. Maybe he'd get so awful good
he'd live under the bed, and we could save our
food for him, and get up nights to play with him."</p>

<p>As if to show his appreciation of the plan, the
Scotty raised himself on his hind quarters, paddling
the air with his forepaws in excited appeal,
and giving vent to sharp, staccato barks.</p>

<p>The next instant the front door was thrown
open, and Mary Ellen, her cap askew, dashed
down the steps to meet us.</p>

<p>"Wheriver have ye been so long?" she
ejaculated. "An' have ye been tould the news?
'Tis hersilf has taken a tumble, an' put her knee
out so the doctor says. I'd jist been clanin' up
the panthry shelves, an' <i>she</i> got up on a chair to
see whether I'd maybe missed the top one, an'
I must have left a knob of soap on the chair,
for the next thing I knew she was stretched on
the flure, an' I had to fetch the doctor, an' he
says she'll have to kape to her room for a fortnight
or more, an' the lord only knows how I'm
to wait on her an' manage the three av ye, wid
yer pranks an' all!"</p>

<p>The Seraph turned a somersault; then I turned
a somersault; then Angel turned two; then the
Scotty sat up, paddled the air with his forepaws,
and sneezed twice.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen was genuinely shocked.</p>

<p>"I do belave," she said, solemnly, "that you've
stones in your breasts instid av hearts&mdash;but
you're jist like all men folk&mdash;if they think there's
a good time in sthore for them, the women can
suffer all they like, more shame to them." She
was so worked up that she did not notice that the
little dog had followed us into the house, until
he was sitting up in the kitchen, his forepaws
paddling the air, his tail thudding on the floor.
Then she said, brimming over with admiration,
though she tried to look severe;</p>

<p>"And if you think I'll have sthray dawgs in
my kitchen you're very much mistook....
Aw, it's a darlin' wee thing, isn't it?" For the
Scotty, seeing that she had seated herself, had
jumped to her lap and now sat there, nose in
air, looking superbly at home.</p>

<p>We closed about her, telling, in chorus, the
story of the bullet-headed boy, and the garbage
heap, and enlarging dramatically on the episode
of the tin can.</p>

<p>"And may we please keep him?" we entreated,
"just for a few days till we find the owner of
it! Mrs. Handsomebody will never know, for
he can live in the coal cellar 'cept when we take
him little walks on a string!"</p>

<p>"If you don't let me do this I'll never marry
you, so there!" This from Angel.</p>

<p>"Have it your own way, thin," moaned Mary
Ellen, capitulating, as usual, under the fire of
Angel's pleading, "but moind, if she iver finds us
out, it's mesilf will be walkin' the streets widout
a character."</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>So began a merry interlude in the drabness of
the Handsomebody regime. Mrs. Handsomebody
kept to her room for nearly three weeks, unable
to put her foot to the floor. On the first
evening, she called us to her bedside; and, while
we stood in a row, bewildered before the phenomenon of seeing her prostrate, she lectured us
solemnly on the duties and responsibilities of our
position, and implored us not to make the period
of her enforced retirement a nightmare, because
of our pranks. We promised, marvelling that
bed-clothes could be kept so tidy, and fervently
wishing she would display the knee that had been
so severely "put out." It was a commonplace
for Mrs. Handsomebody's temper to be thus
afflicted, but her knee, never.</p>

<p>When we returned to the kitchen, we found
Mary Ellen sitting in a pensive attitude. Her
forefinger pressed against her knit brow, her
stout ankles crossed.</p>

<p>"The little dawg has been tellin' me a secret,"
she volunteered in explanation, "a deep, dark secret.
She's been tellin' me in a way of spakin'
that she's a lady-dawg, God help her."</p>

<p>"But how did she tell you, Mary Ellen? Did
she speak out loud?" We were breathless with
excitement.</p>

<p>"She did not. I ast her, for I had me suspicion,
if she was a lady-dawg an' I sez&mdash;'If yez
are wag yer tail three times,' an' the words was
scarce off me tongue, whin she wagged her tail
three times."</p>

<p>It was a marvel. Oh, these were going to be
great days!</p>

<p>"If you're a lady-dog, wag your tail three
times," I ordered, squatting to peer into the
sagacious brown eyes.</p>

<p>Three times the stocky tail thumped the floor.</p>

<p>Then Angel put the question, and was answered
with equal promptitude.</p>

<p>It was The Seraph's turn. With an insinuating
smile he said: "If you are a gennelman dog
wag your tail fwee times."</p>

<p>But before there was time for so much as one
wag, Mary Ellen caught the too-eager tail in a
restraining grasp.</p>

<p>"Now have done wid your nonsinse," she commanded.
"Ye'll have the pore crature that worried
it'll set up barkin', an' if the misthress did
know, there be's a dawg in the house, she'd likely
just throw a fit an' die."</p>

<p>"Is it a vewy barkable dog?" queried The
Seraph.</p>

<p>"All dogs is barkable," said Mary Ellen, "and
what we'll have to do is to kape her as quate as
possible and pray that her owner'll come along
this way, for turn her out I will not. It's easy
seein' she's a pet be the ways of her."</p>

<p>"It says 'Giftie' on her collar," Angel announced,
separating the short, shaggy coat to
read. "That must be her name. Hello, Giftie!
Sit up, Giftie!"</p>

<p>So Giftie she was, and, for a long three weeks,
our joy and our delight.</p>

<p>Was ever little body so full of spirit and the
pride of life? The kitchen became her own
domain where the three of us fought for the
position of her most abject slave. Even Mary
Ellen could scarcely work for watching her antics
with an old stocking, which she pretended was a
rat. Once she caught a live mouse and set us
all shouting. Mary Ellen, in her excitement, upset
a gravy-boat of hot gravy, and The Seraph
slipped and sat down in it, and Giftie gambolling,
mouse in mouth, ran through it and tracked it
over the freshly scrubbed boards. If she had
been a tigress with her prey she could not have
been more ferocious with the mouse. She
snarled at it: she worried it: she threw it up in
the air and caught it: she laid it on the scullery
floor and rolled on it: and when, finally, it ceased
to squirm beneath her, she lay quite still, gazing
pensively up at us with liquid eyes, and only now
and then twitching her hind-quarters to remind
her victim that she was still on the job.</p>

<p>One never-to-be-forgotten day she rollicked
into the kitchen proudly carrying Mrs. Handsomebody's
solemn black shoe, which had been
standing with its mate beneath Mrs. Handsomebody's
bed. Before our horrified eyes, she worried
it till the shoe-laces cracked about her head;
threw it up and caught it, as she had the mouse;
then taking it to her own bed in the scullery, she
laid it there and rolled on it.</p>

<p>When Mary Ellen had wrested the shoe from
Giftie, she crept upstairs, her heart in her mouth,
and restored it to its place beneath the bed.</p>

<p>"It was a marvel," she said afterwards, "how
the scallywag did what she did widout wakenin'
<i>her</i>, for there was the mistress sleepin' on the
broad of her back, and her two shoes, and her
bed-socks scattered over the flure, and the pot
of cold crame knocked off the chair at the head
of her bed, and the half of it et. It's mesilf
will dance for joy whin that little tormint gets
took away."</p>

<p>Inquiries were made of all the errand boys,
but not one had heard of a lost dog. We came
to dread the sound of the door-bell lest it should
herald some determined grown-up come to snatch
our treasure from us. Mr. Watlin, the butcher's
young man, and Mary Ellen's favoured "follower"
of the moment, took a lively interest in
the affair. He was of the opinion that if Mrs.
Handsomebody once saw the dog nothing would
induce her to send it away. And he brought
offerings of raw meat in his pocket to make her
plump and glossy. Giftie grew plumper and
glossier every day.</p>

<p>Then, when two weeks had passed, she
achieved the crowning triumph of her stay with
us. It was a heavy morning of dense November
fog, and the gas was still burning in the dining-room
when we came down to breakfast. Mary
Ellen did not bring us our porridge, as usual,
neither did Giftie run in to greet us; so, after a
moment's impatient wriggling in our chairs, we
went to the kitchen to investigate. Giftie was
nowhere in sight. Mary Ellen sat in an attitude
of complete abandon, by the dresser, her apron
over her head, her arms hanging loosely at her
sides. Was Giftie dead? Had her owner come
to fetch her? What horror had overcast the
sun? We deluged her with questions, pulling
the apron off her head, and dragging her from
the chair.</p>

<p>"Och, it's a terror she is," Mary Ellen said, at
last. "Come wid me to the scullery an' ye'll see
what she's got in the bed wid her."</p>

<p>There was not much light in the scullery so
we could not at first distinguish what lay on the
mat beside Giftie. It moved; it snuffled; no&mdash;<i>they</i>
moved; <i>they</i> snuffled. There were three of
them. All at once it burst upon us that they were
puppies&mdash;her puppies&mdash;our puppies&mdash;one apiece!
We flopped on the floor beside her. She darted
from her bed&mdash;licked our hands&mdash;snapped at our
ankles&mdash;ran back to them&mdash;and, finally tremulous
with excitement, allowed us to take them in our
arms (The Seraph wrapped his in the skirt of
his fresh holland smock) and sit blissfully in
a row.</p>

<p>We stroked the soft licked fur of their glossy
coats; we examined their tiny sharp black nails;
their blindness only endeared them the more to
us.</p>

<p>There we were found by Mr. Watlin.</p>

<p>"'Ere's a picnic," he said. "'Ere's a bloomin'
picnic." He caught up the nearest puppy, and
turned it over in an experienced hand. "Tiles
must be cut," he added.</p>

<p>"Tails cut! Oh, no," I expostulated, "Giftie's
tail isn't cut. Please don't."</p>

<p>"All terriers should 'ave their tiles cut," said
Mr. Watlin, firmly. "If the mother dog's tile
isn't cut, is that any reason w'y 'er hoffspring
should be disfigured in a like manner? Now's
the time."</p>

<p>"But it'll hurt," pleaded The Seraph. Do
you do it wif a knife?"</p>

<p>"I <i>bites</i> 'em orf," replied Mr. Watlin, laconically,
"an' it don't 'urt a bit."</p>

<p>"In this world," he went on, "a lot depends on
the way you does a thing. F'rinstance, when I
kill a lamb or a steer, do I kill 'im brutally? Not
at all. I runs 'im up an' down the slaughter yard
to get 'is circulation up&mdash;I strokes 'im on the neck,
an' tells 'im wot a fine feller 'e is, till 'e's in such
good spirits that 'e tikes the killin' as a joke.
Just a part of the gime, as it were. Sime with
these 'ere pups. They'd like 'aving their tiles bit
orf by me."</p>

<p>We looked at the puppies doubtfully. It was
hard to believe that they would really like it, and
we were relieved when Mary Ellen broke in&mdash;</p>

<p>"They will not be cut, nor bit, nor interfered
wid in anny way. If Giftie's owner likes a long
tail on her, he'd want a long tail on her puppies
wouldn't he? That stands to reason, Mr.
Watlin, don't it? and the owner may walk in here
anny day."</p>

<p>How we hated that nebulous owner! And now
another cloud loomed on our horizon. Mrs.
Handsomebody was getting better. She had sat
up on a chair by the bedside; she had, with Mary
Ellen's help, walked across the room; she had, all
alone, walked down the hallway; she had come to
the head of the stairs. She was like the man in
the ghost story, who, fresh from his grave, called
to his wife&mdash;snugly sleeping above&mdash;"Mary, I'm
at the foot of the stairs.... Mary, I'm half way
up." We, too, shuddered in anticipation. And
Mary Ellen was almost as nervous as we, for hers
was the responsibility.</p>

<p>The puppies were more entrancing every day.
Tiny slips of dewy blue showed between their
furry eyelids. They learned to walk, and roll
over, and to right themselves after being turned
over by their mother's playful paws. We were
squatting on the floor very busy with them, when
Mary Ellen entered, round-eyed with fear.</p>

<p>"'Tis herself is in the dining-room," she
gasped.</p>

<p>"Not Mrs. Handsomebody?"</p>

<p>"Sorra a thing else. Put them pups in their
basket and come out and shut the dure. Ye'd
better go into the yard and be at some quate game.
Oh, Lord&mdash;" and she hurried back to her
mistress.</p>

<p>This time we were safe, but there was tomorrow
ahead, with certain discovery.</p>

<p>Mr. Watlin, propped in the open doorway,
brought his ingenious mind to bear upon the
problem.</p>

<p>"Now if Mrs. 'Andsomebody could be put under
an obligation to that little dog, she'd probably
tike it right into 'er 'eart and 'ome. If that little
dog, f'rinstance, should save Mrs. 'Andsomebody
from drowning&mdash;does she ever go in bathing?"</p>

<p>"<i>Likely</i>, at <i>her</i> age, in <i>December</i>!" sneered
Mary Ellen. "Try again."</p>

<p>"We might hold her under water in the bath-tub
till Giftie would fish her out," suggested
Angel.</p>

<p>It was a colourful spectacle to visualize, and we
dallied with it a space before abandoning it as impracticable. It seemed too much to hope that
Mrs. Handsomebody, the bath-tub and Giftie
could all be assembled at the critical moment.</p>

<p>But Mr. Watlin was not to be rebuffed. "Then
there's burglars," he went on. "Suppose Mrs.
'Andsomebody's valuables was to be rescued from
a burglar for 'er. She wouldn't be able to do
enough for a little dog that 'ad chased 'im out of
this very scullery, f'rinstance."</p>

<p>We were thrilled by hope. "But where is the
burglar?"</p>

<p>"Well, I could produce the burglar in a pinch.
He's reformed but he'd undertake a little job like
this if he know'd it was for partic'lar friends of
mine, and not a bit of 'arm in it. Is it a go?"</p>

<p>Mystery brooded over the house of Handsomebody
all that afternoon and evening. We were
allowed to have no finger in this portentous pie.</p>

<p>Mr. Watlin, with some small assistance from
Mary Ellen, engineered the thing himself. We
were sent to bed at the usual hour, and played at
burglars on, and under, the bed, to while away
the intervening hours.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>It must have been almost midnight when our
hearts were made to beat in our throats by such
an uproar in the scullery, as seemed to cleave the
darkness like a thunderbolt. Giftie appeared to
be choking in her effort to unloose, all at once, a
torrent of ferocious barks. A window shook,
glass broke, a shutter slammed. Then followed a
moment of awful silence before she settled down
to a methodical yapping. We heard Mary Ellen
run down the back stairs.</p>

<p>We clambered out of bed, and tumbled into the
hall. Mrs. Handsomebody was there before us,
a gigantic shadow of her thrown on the walls by
a candle she held unsteadily in her hand.</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" she was saying under her
breath. "What can have happened!" She motioned
us to fall in behind her, and it was plain
that, crippled as she was, she intended to interpose
her body, in its flannel nightgown, between
us and whatever danger lurked below. She made
the descent clinging to the bannister, the three
of us jostling each other in the rear, and, once,
nearly precipitated on her back by a caper of
Angel's on the edge of a step.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen met us in the dining-room, her face
pale with excitement.</p>

<p>"It was a burglar in the scullery, ma'am," she
burst out, never looking at us. "It's a mercy we
wasn't all murthered in our beds this night&mdash;the
windy's broke, an' the shutter's pried loose, and
a bag full av all the things off the sideboard is
settin' on the flure. Sure, I heard the steps av
him runnin' full lick down the lane&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody looked at her bereft sideboard,
and dropped into a chair with a gasp.</p>

<p>"Are you <i>sure</i> he's gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. I stuck me head out the windy and
seen him."</p>

<p>"You're a brave girl. Get me the bitters.
Yes, and lock the door into the scullery&mdash;stay,
what dog was it that barked?"</p>

<p>Mary Ellen hung her head. "The dawg the
little boys have been keepin' this bit while. It
does no harm at all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody's face was a mask. She
said composedly: "Well, get the bitters and
then bring in the dog."</p>

<p>Mary Ellen did as she was bid.</p>

<p>Enter now Giftie, tail up, ears pricked, the
picture of conscious well-doing. She went
straight to Mrs. Handsomebody, sniffed her
ankles; wagged her tail in appreciation of the
odour of the liniment that emanated from the injured
lady; and finally sat up before her with an
ingratiating paddling of the forepaws.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody regarded her sombrely.
"May I ask how long you have harboured this
stray?"</p>

<p>"Just since the day ye fell, ma'am, and I was
that upset that I was scarce in me right moind,
and indade, it's hersilf has saved us from robbery
and mebbe murther this night wid her barkin'."</p>

<p>Giftie, tired of sitting up without reward or
encouragement, had trotted quietly out of the
room. She now came back waddling with importance,
a pup in her mouth. She laid it
at the feet of our governess as though to say&mdash;"There
now, what do you make of that?"</p>

<p>"Horrors!" cried Mrs. Handsomebody, drawing
back, as though the puppy were a serpent.</p>

<p>With a joyful kick of the heels, Giftie was off
again. In breathless silence we waited. The
second puppy, sleepy and squirming, was laid beside
its brother.</p>

<p>"I presume you have another?" said Mrs.
Handsomebody in a controlled voice but gripping
the arms of her chair.</p>

<p>Giftie brought the other.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Handsomebody!" I implored,
"please, please, let us keep them! They're as
good as gold, and they'd guard the house and
everything&mdash;and maybe save you from drowning
some time. Don't take them from us, pl-ease!"
The Seraph, in sympathy, began to cry. Angel
picked up his pup and held it against his breast.</p>

<p>"Silence!" rapped out Mrs. Handsomebody.
"Mary Ellen, fetch <i>The Times</i>. And just look
in the scullery to see that all is quiet there.
Fetch the bag left by the robber."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody sipped her bitters while
Mary Ellen did her behests. Each of us cuddled his own puppy, and Giftie began an energetic
search for a flea.</p>

<p>Had our hearts not been in the grip of apprehension
we should have laughed at the figure
cut by Mary Ellen, panting under the sack of
plate. Mr. Watlin's burglar had done his job
well, and Mrs. Handsomebody groaned when she
saw her most cherished possessions tumbled in
such a reckless fashion. But not a thing was
missing, and when they had been replaced on the
sideboard, she turned briskly to <i>The Times</i>. She
ran a long white finger down the Lost column.</p>

<p>"Ah, here we are&mdash;" she announced, complacently&mdash;"Pay
attention, boys," and she read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Reward</i> for information leading to the recovery of
Scottish terrier, female, wearing silver collar engraved,
Giftie, stolen or strayed from 5 Argyle Road, on November
third. Anyone detaining after this notice will be
prosecuted."</p></blockquote>

<p>"You see," exclaimed Mrs. Handsomebody,
triumphantly, "you have made yourselves liable
to a heavy fine, or even imprisonment, by detaining
what is, I presume, a very valuable beast.
Argyle Road&mdash;a very good locality&mdash;is not too
great a distance for you to walk. In the morning,
we shall return that dog and her&mdash;er&mdash;young,
and I see nothing amiss in your accepting
a suitable reward. Not a word now! No insubordination,
mind. I won't have it. David,
John, Alexander, listen&mdash;I am in no mood to
be trifled with. Put down those squirming
creatures and march to your bed!"</p>

<p>Giftie's hour had struck. It was no use rebelling.
With bitter composure, we carried our
beloved to the scullery, and laid them on the mat
beside their mother. It was not until we were
safe in bed that our pent up fury broke loose;
and we pounded the pillows, and cursed the name
of womankind.</p>

<p>Women! Tyrants! Mischievous busybodies!</p>

<p>"When I'm a man," said Angel, suddenly, "I'll
marry a woman, and I'll beat her every day."</p>

<p>"Me too!" cried The Seraph, stoutly, "I'll
mawy two&mdash;fat ones&mdash;an' beat 'em bofe."</p>

<p>For myself, I was inclined for an unhampered
bachelorhood, but it soothed my wounded spirit
to picture these three hapless females in the grip
of Angel and The Seraph, and the music of their
outcries lulled me fast asleep.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>We found next morning that Mrs. Handsomebody
and Mary Ellen had never gone back to
bed all night, but had kept watch in the dining-room
till daylight, when Mary Ellen had been
dispatched to find a policeman. He was in the
kitchen now, a commanding figure, making notes
in a little book; and seeming to derive great benefit
from his conversation with Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>A new arrival was a wheeled-chair to convey
Mrs. Handsomebody to 5 Argyle Road. Therefore,
about ten o'clock, after the most exhausting
preparations, we set out, a singular party; Mrs.
Handsomebody enthroned in the chair, mistress
of herself (and every one else) her black-gloved
hands crossed on her lap; Mary Ellen, hot, straining
over the wheeled-chair, lest her mistress get an
unseemly bump at the crossing; Angel and I, bearing
between us a covered hamper containing the
three pups; while Giftie and The Seraph in the
abandon of youth and ignorance, sported on the
outskirts of the group.</p>

<p>The way was long, and our arms ached with
the weight of the hamper, when we stopped before
the gate of Number 5 Argyle Road. It
was an imposing house in its own grounds; large
clipped trees stood about; and a bent old gardener
was doing something to one of those, while a tall
grey-haired woman in mannish tweeds superintended
the work. A Scottish terrier, fit mate
for Giftie, was digging furiously at the root of
the tree. He discovered our presence first, and,
before we had time to introduce ourselves, he
and Giftie, with bristling backs, were jumping
about one another in a sort of friendly hostility,
and filling the air with barks of greeting. Giftie,
then, darted for the hamper, sniffed it, ran back
to the other Scotty, and bit him so that he yelped.
All was confusion.</p>

<p>The tall lady came toward us smiling broadly.
She exclaimed above the din: "How can I thank
you? I see you have brought home our little
wanderer&mdash;Giftie, how can you treat Colin so?
Poor Colin&mdash;lift him up, Giles, she's going to
bite him again&mdash;I suppose there are pups in the
hamper. Let's see, boys."</p>

<p>We uncovered the hamper proudly. The
three puppies lay curled like little sea anemones.
Giftie tried to get in the hamper with them, but
her mistress restrained her gently, while she
lifted them out, one by one, and examined each,
critically, Mrs. Handsomebody watching her all
the while with an expression of disapproval, that
bordered on disgust.</p>

<p>The tall lady, quite oblivious to all this, seated
herself on the ground with the puppies on her
lap, muttering ecstatically-"Perfect beauties&mdash;what
luck! Giftie, you're a wonder!" Whereupon
Giftie tried to kiss her on the ear. The
bent old gardener, brought Colin to us and made
him shake hands, and we thought him very long-faced
and dour after roguish Giftie.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Handsomebody spoke in her
most decisive tones:</p>

<p>"I fear I shall take a chill if I remain in this
damp place. Come boys. Mary Ellen, kindly
reverse the chair!"</p>

<p>The tall lady rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, come in and have something hot,
and tell me all about it. And there's the reward."</p>

<p>"I thank you," replied Mrs. Handsomebody,
"I shall not venture to leave my chair. As for
the dog, it came to us several weeks ago, when
I was ill; hence the delay in returning it&mdash;and
its young."</p>

<p>"Your grandchildren?" questioned the tall
lady abruptly.</p>

<p>"My pupils, and, for the present, my wards,"
replied Mrs. Handsomebody frigidly.</p>

<p>"Wish I could steal them," said the lady. "If
I'd dogs and boys too, I'd be happy. These are
darlings." She turned to us then. "Boys, do
you like Giftie very much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we love her," we chorused.</p>

<p>"Would you like one of her puppies for your
very own to keep?"</p>

<p>Would we? We couldn't speak for longing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody spoke for us.</p>

<p>"I allow no pets, canine or otherwise."</p>

<p>The tall lady scowled. "But these are valuable dogs."</p>

<p>"All dogs are alike to me. Canines."</p>

<p>The tall lady gave something between a snort
and a sigh.</p>

<p>"Would you allow them to accept a sovereign
apiece then?"</p>

<p>"That would be permissible."</p>

<p>"I shall be back directly," and with astonishing
speed she ran to the house with Colin and
Giftie barking on either side of her. It was but
a moment till she returned and pressed a golden
sovereign into each languid hand. The sight of
so much bullion all at once braced us for the
moment, and we forgot to be miserable. She
came with us to the gate, asking a dozen questions
about ourselves, and our father, and Giftie's
stay with us. Giftie had to be restrained from
following us, and with sinking hearts we kissed
her little black nose and said good-bye.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" called the tall lady, "come again
any time! Come and spend the day with us!"</p>

<p>Our governess called us peremptorily. She
was half a block in advance.</p>

<p>When we reached the chair, she said, in a conciliatory tone:
"I shall arrange for you to have
some unusual treat from your reward, some concerts
and lantern lectures suited to your years,
and maybe, as the Christmas Season approaches,
even a pantomime. What do you say?"</p>

<p>I looked at the woman. Was she mad to
imagine that such paltry, sickly treats could make
up for the loss of three pups whose eyes were
beginning to open? My own eyes smarted with
tears. I looked at Mary Ellen. Two bright
drops hung on her cheeks as she laboured behind
the chair. I looked at Angel. He was balancing
himself on the curb with an air of desperate
indifference. I could hear The Seraph weeping
as he brought up the rear.</p>

<p>I lingered behind to offer him a suck of a piece
of licorice I had. Then I saw that he had
stopped and was hunched above the grating of a
sewer. I could but think that his spirits had
reached such an ebb that nothing save the contemplation
of the foulest depths might salve his
misery. But I was mistaken! His hand moved
above the grating. Something flashed. Then I
swelled my chest with pride in him. Truly, The
Seraph was a brother to be proud of&mdash;a fellow
of sturdy passions, not to be trifled with!</p>

<p>He had chucked his sovereign down the sewer!</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch5">Chapter V: Freedom</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Life became dull indeed after Giftie was taken
from us. November drew on to December;
beating rains kept us indoors for days at a time.
Mrs. Handsomebody had a horror of wet feet.
With faces pressed against streaming window
panes, we watched for the blurred progress of
the lamplighter down the street, as the one excitement
of the day. Even our friend the Bishop
deserted us and went for a long stay in the south
of France. Angel developed a sore throat just
before Christmas so we had no part in the Christmas
music in the Cathedral. The toy pistols
sent by our father did not arrive till a fortnight
after Christmas, and when they did arrive,
the joy of possessing them was short-lived,
for after Angel had cracked a pane of
glass with his, and I had hit Mary Ellen on
the ear, so that it was swollen and red for days,
Mrs. Handsomebody confiscated them all as
dangerous weapons to be kept till we were beyond
her control.</p>

<p>She gave us each a new prayer book illustrated
by pictures from the Gospel. I coloured the
pictures in mine with crayons, and got my hands
rulered for it; Angel traded his with one of the
choir boys for a catapult which he successfully
kept in concealment, with occasional forays on
back alley cats. The Seraph was immensely
pleased with his. He carried it about in his
blouse, producing it, now and again, for reference,
with pretended solemnity. His manner
became unbearably clerical. I think he felt himself,
at least, a Canon.</p>

<p>The winter wore on, and we became pale and
peevish from lack of air, when all our little world
was quickened by the coming of the telegram.</p>

<p>It had come while we were at lessons. Angel
and I were standing before our governess with
our hands behind our backs, when Mary Ellen
burst in at the door. I had been stumbling over
the names of the Channel Islands, and I stopped
with my mouth open, relieved to see Mrs. Handsomebody's
look of indignation raised from my
face to that of Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>"Is that the way I have instructed you to
enter the room where I sit?" asked Mrs. Handsomebody
sternly.</p>

<p>"Lord, no, ma'am," gasped Mary Ellen, "but
it's a telegram I've brung for ye, an' I thought
as it was likely bad news, ye wouldn't want to be
kept waitin' while I'd rap at the dure!" She
presented the bit of paper between a wet thumb
and forefinger.</p>

<p>"You may take your seats," said Mrs. Handsomebody
coldly, to us.</p>

<p>Angel and I slipped into our places at the
long book-littered table, on either side of The
Seraph. We were thus placed, in order that
his small plump person should prove an obstacle
to familiar intercourse between Angel and myself
during school hours; and, as our intercourse
usually took the form of punches in the short
ribs, or wet paper pellets aimed at an unoffending
nose, The Seraph was frequently the recipient
of such pleasantries. He bore them with good
humour and stoicism.</p>

<p>"I'll bet anything," whispered Angel, over The
Seraph's curls, "that it's a telegram from father
saying that he's coming to fetch us! Wouldn't
that be jolly? And she's waxy about it too&mdash;see
how white she's gone!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody rose.</p>

<p>"Boys," she said, in her most frigid manner,
"owing to news of a sudden bereavement, I shall
not be able to continue your lessons today&mdash;nor
tomorrow. You will, I hope, make the most
of the time intervening. You were in a shocking
state of unpreparedness both in History and
Geography this morning. Keep your little
brother out of mischief, and <i>remember</i>," raising
her long forefinger, "you are not, under any consideration,
to leave the premises during my absence.
As I have a great responsibility on your
account, I wish to be certain that you are not endangering
yourselves in the street. When I return
we shall undertake some long walks."</p>

<p>Picking up the telegram from the floor where
it had fallen, Mrs. Handsomebody slowly left
the room, and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>"She's always jawing about her responsibility,"
muttered Angel resentfully. "Why don't she let
us run about like other boys 'stead of mewing us
up like a parcel of girls? I'll be shot if I stand it!"</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> the Channel Islands anyhow?" I
asked to change the subject. "I'd just got to
Jersey, Guernsey, when I got stuck."</p>

<p>"Jersey, Guernsey, Sweater, Sock and Darn,"
replied my elder, emphasizing the last named.</p>

<p>"<i>Was</i> the telegram from father?" interrupted
The Seraph. "Is he comin' home?"</p>

<p>"No, silly," replied Angel. "Some one belonging
to Mrs. Handsomebody is dead. She's goin'
to the funeral, I s'pose. Whoever can it be,
John? Didn't know <i>she</i> had any people."</p>

<p>"A whole day away," I mused, "it has never
happened before."</p>

<p>I looked at Angel, and Angel looked at me&mdash;such
looks as might be exchanged by lion cubs in
captivity. We remembered our old home with
its stretch of green lawn, the dogs, the stable
with the sharp sweet smell of hay, and the
pigeons, sliding and "rooketty-cooing" on the
roof. Here, the windows of our schoolroom
looked out on a planked back yard, and our
daily walks with Mrs. Handsomebody were
dreary outings indeed.</p>

<p>Of a sudden Angel threw his Geography into
the air. His brown eyes were sparkling.</p>

<p>"We'll make a day of it, Lieutenant," he cried,
slapping me on the shoulder. He always called
me Lieutenant where mischief was a-foot. "Such
a day as <i>never</i> was! We'll do every blessed
thing we're s'posed not to! Most of all&mdash;we'll
<i>run the streets</i>!"</p>

<p>At that instant, Mary Ellen opened the door
and put her rosy face in.</p>

<p>"She do be packin' her bag, byes," she
whispered, "she's takin' the eliven o'clock train,
an' she won't be back till tomorrow at noon.
Now what d'ye think o' that? She's awful
quate, but she's niver spilt a tear fer him that I
could spot."</p>

<p>"For who?"</p>

<p>"Why, her brother to be sure. It's him that's
dead. It's a attack of brownkitis that's carried
him off so suddint. Her only brother an'&mdash;yes,
ma'a'm, I'm comin'," her broad face disappeared,
"I was on'y tellin' the young gintlemen to be
nice an' quate while I git their dinner ready.
Will they be havin' the cold mutten from yisterday
ma'a'm?" Her voice trailed down the
hall.</p>

<p>Presently we heard the front door close. We
raced to the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Is she gone?" we whispered, peering over
the bannister into the hall below. But, of course,
she was gone, else Mary Ellen would never dare
to stand thus in the open doorway, gaping up
and down the street! We slid recklessly down
the hand-rail. It was the first infringement of
rules&mdash;the wig was on the green! We crowded
about Mary Ellen in the doorway, sniffing the
air.</p>

<p>"Och, it's a bad lot ye are!" said she, taking
The Seraph under the arms and swinging him out
over the steps, "shure it's small wonder the missus
is strict wid ye, else ye'd be ridin' rough-shod over
her as ye do over me! It's jist man-nature, mind
ye&mdash;ye can't help it!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's not man-nature to be mewed up as
she does us," said Angel, swaggering, "and, I
don't know what you mean to do, Mary Ellen,
but <i>we</i> mean to take a day off, so there!" He
nodded his curly head defiantly at her.</p>

<p>"Now, listen here, byes," said Mary Ellen,
turning sober all of a sudden, and shutting the
door, "you come right out to the kitchen wid me,
an' we'll talk this thing over. I've got a word
to say to ye."</p>

<p>She led the way down the hall and through the
dining-room with its atmosphere of haircloth, into
the more friendly kitchen, where even the oppressions
of Mrs. Handsomebody could not quite subdue
the bounding spirits of Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>Angel sallied to the cupboard. "Bother!" he
said, discontentedly, investigating the cake-box,
"that same old seedy-cake! Won't you <i>please</i>
make us a treat today, Mary Ellen? Jam tarts
or some sticky sort of cake like you see in the pastry
shop window."</p>

<p>"That's the very thing I was goin' to speak
about, my dear," Mary Ellen replied, "if ye'll jist
howld yer horses." Before proceeding, she cut
us each, herself included, a slice of the seed cake,
and, when we were all munching (save Angel, who
was busy picking the seeds out of his cake) she
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, as well ye know, I've worked here
manny a long month, and I've had followers
a-plinty, yit there's noan o' thim I like the same
as Mr. Watlin, the butcher's young man, an' it
makes me blush wid shame, whin I think that
after all the pippermints, an' gum drops, an' jawbone
breakers he's give me, not to speak of
minsthral shows an' rides on the tram-cars, an'
I've niver given him so much as a cup o' tay in this
kitchen. Not <i>wan</i> cup o' tay, mind ye!"</p>

<p>We shook our heads commiseratingly. Angel
flicked his last caraway seed at her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well," he said, with a wink, "you gave him
something better than tea&mdash;I saw you!"</p>

<p>"Aw, well, my dear," replied Mary Ellen, without
smiling, "a man that do be boardin' all the
time likes a little attintion sometimes&mdash;an' a taste
o' home cookin'. Now hark to my plan. I mane
to have a little feast of oyster stew, an' cake, an'
coffee, an' the like this very night, fer Mr. Watlin
an' me, an' yersilves. You kin have yours in the
dining-room like little gintlemen, an' him an' me'll
ate in the kitchen here. Thin, after the supper,
ye kin come out an' hear Mr. Watlin play on the
fiddle. He plays somethin' grand, havin' larned
off the best masters. It'll be a rale treat fer ye!
The missus 'll niver be the wiser, an' we'll all git
a taste o' <i>freedom</i>, d'ye see?"</p>

<p>We were unanimous in our approval, The Seraph
expressing his by a somersault.</p>

<p>"But," said Angel, "there's just one thing,
Mary Ellen; if there's going to be a party you
and Mr. Watlin have got to have yours in the
dining-room the same as us. It'll be ever so much
jollier, and more like a real party."</p>

<p>"Thrue fer ye, Master Angel!" cried Mary
Ellen heartily, "sure, there's noan o' the stiff-neck
about ye, an' ye'll git yer fill av oysters an' cake
fer that, mark my words! As fer my Mr.
Watlin, there ain't a claner, smarter feller to be
found annywheres. But, oh, if the mistress was
to find it out&mdash;" she turned pale with apprehension.</p>

<p>"How could she?" we assured her. Every curtain
would be drawn, and, besides, Mrs. Handsomebody
was not intimate with her neighbours.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen gave us our cold mutton and rice
pudding that day in free and easy fashion. She
did not place the dishes and cutlery with that
mathematical precision demanded of her by Mrs.
Handsomebody, but scattered them over the cloth
in a promiscuous way that we found very exhilarating.
And, instead of Mrs. Handsomebody's
austere figure dominating our repast, there was
Mary Ellen, resting her red knuckles on the table-cloth,
and fairly bubbling over with plans for the
prospective entertainment of her lover! Our
hearts went out to the good girl and her Mr. Watlin.
We began to think of him as a dear friend.</p>

<p>"Now, my dears," said she, when the meal was
over, "take yourselves off while I clane up and do
my shoppin', but fer pity's sake, don't lave the
front garden, fer if annything was to happen to
ye&mdash;"</p>

<p>Angel cut her short with&mdash;"None of that Mary
Ellen! This is <i>our</i> day too, and we shall do
what we jolly well please!" He completed his
protest by throwing himself bodily on the stout
domestic, and The Seraph and I, though we had
eaten to repletion, followed his example. Mary
Ellen, howbeit, was a match for the three of us,
and bundled us out of the side entrance into the
laneway, triumphantly locking the door upon us.</p>

<p>Without a look behind, we scampered to the
street, and then stood still, staring at each other,
dazzled by the vista that opened up before us&mdash;what
to do with these glorious hours of freedom!</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>It was one of those late February days, when
Nature, after months of frozen disregard for
man, of a sudden smiles, and you see that her face
has grown quite young, and that she is filled with
gracious intent towards you. The bare limbs of
the chestnut trees before the house looked shiny
against the dim blue of the sky; they seemed to
strain upward toward the light and warmth. A
score of sparrows were busy on the roadway.</p>

<p>After all, it was The Seraph who made the first
dash, who took the bit in his milk-teeth, as it were;
and, without a by-your-leave, strutted across the
strip of sod to the road, and so set forth. He
carried his head very high, and he would now and
then shake it in that manner peculiar to the equine
race. Angel and I followed closely with occasional caracoles, and cavortings, and scornful
blowings through the nostrils. All three shied at
a lamp-post. It needed no second glance to perceive
that we were mettlesome steeds out for exercise,
and feeling our oats.</p>

<p>A very old gentleman with an umbrella and top
hat saw us. He rushed to the curb waving his
umbrella and crying, "Whoa, whoa," but we only
arched our proud necks and broke into a gallop.
How the pavement echoed under our flying hoofs!
How warmly the sun glistened on our sleek coats!
How pleasant the jingling sound of the harness
and the smell of the harness oil!</p>

<p>We left the decorous street we knew so
well, and turned into narrow and untidy Henwood
street. Shabby houses and shops were jumbled
promiscuously together, and the pavement was
full of holes. From the far end of it came the
joyous tones of a hand-organ, vibrating on the
early afternoon air. The eaves on the sunny
side of the street were dripping. A fishmonger's
shop sent forth its robust odour. The scarlet of
a lobster caught our eyes as we flew past.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that the player of the organ
was our old friend Tony, to whose monkey
we had often handed our coppers through the
palings?</p>

<p>We were horses no longer. Who had time for
such pretence when Tony was grinding out "White
Wings" with all his might? Angel and I took to
the side-walk and ran with all speed, leaving the
poor little Seraph pumping away in the rear, not
quite certain whether he was horse or boy, but
determined not to be outdistanced.</p>

<p>It was indeed Tony, and his white teeth
gleamed when he saw us coming, and his eyebrows
went up to his hat brim at sight of us bareheaded
and alone, who always handed our coppers
through the palings. And Anita, the monkey,
was there, looking rather pale and sickly after the
long Winter, but full of pluck, grinning, as she
doffed her gold-braided hat.</p>

<p>Angel and The Seraph rarely had any money.
The little allowance father gave us through Mrs.
Handsomebody, burnt a hole in their pockets till
it was expended on toffee or marshmallows. But
I was made of different stuff, and by the end of
the week, I was the financial strength of the trio.
It was I, who now fished out a penny which Angel
snatched from me. He craved the joy of the
giver, and chuckled when Anita's small pink palm
closed over the coin. But I was too happy to
quarrel with him. Every one seemed in good-humour
that day. Windows were pushed up and
small change tossed out, or dropped in Anita's
cup as she perched, chattering, on the sill. A
stout grocer in his white apron gave her a little
pink biscuit to nibble. Half-grown girls lolled
on the handles of perambulators to listen, while
their charges pulled faces of fear at the supple
Anita.</p>

<p>We three sat on the curb close to the organ,
our small heads reeling with the melodies that
thundered from it. When Tony moved on, we
rose and followed him. At the next corner he
rested his organ on its one leg and looked down
at us.</p>

<p>"You betta go home," he admonished, "your
mamma not like."</p>

<p>"We're going to run the streets today," I said,
manfully, "Mrs. Handsomebody is away at a
funeral."</p>

<p>"A funer-al," repeated Tony, "she know&mdash;about
dis?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;" I replied, "but Mary Ellen does."</p>

<p>"She a beeg lady&mdash;dis Marie Ellen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She's awfully big. Bigger than
you, and strong&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," said Tony, "but don' you get
los'." We helped him to carry the organ. It
was a new one he said, and very expensive to
hire. We asked him endless questions we had
always been wanting to ask&mdash;about Italy, and
his parents, and sisters, and we told him about
father in South America, and about the party
that night for Mr. Watlin.</p>

<p>From street to street we wandered till we were
gloriously and irrevocably lost. Angel and I
helped to grind the organ and The Seraph even
presented himself at doors with Anita's little tin
cup in his hand. And either because he was so
little or his eyelashes were so long, he never
came back empty-handed. Tony seemed well
content with our company.</p>

<p>So the afternoon sped on. Narrow alleys we
played in, and wide streets, and once we passed
through a crowded thoroughfare where we had
to hug close to the organ, and once we met Tony's
brother Salvator, who gave us each a long red
banana.</p>

<p>At last Tony, looking down at us with a smile,
said:</p>

<p>"Jus' one more tune here, then I tak' you
home. See? De sun's gettin' low and dat little
one's gettin' tired. I tak' you home in a minute."</p>

<p>We, remembering the party, were nothing
loath. Poor Mary Ellen would be in a state by
now, and our legs had almost given out.</p>

<p>This street was a quiet one. At the corner
some untidy little girls danced on the pavement,
while a group of boys stood by, loafing against
the window of a small liquor shop, and occasionally
scattering the girls by some threat of
hair-pulling or kissing.</p>

<p>The western sky was saffron. The eaves,
that had been dripping all day, now wore silent
rows of icicles. Possibly the little girls danced
to keep warm. The Seraph began to whimper.</p>

<p>"This air stwikes cold on my legs," he murmured.</p>

<p>I sat down beside him on the curb, and we
snuggled together for warmth.</p>

<p>"Never mind, old sport," I whispered cheerily.
"Just think of the goodies Mary Ellen's
making for us! Pretty soon we'll be home."</p>

<p>While I strove to revive The Seraph's flagging
spirits, Angel had strolled along the street
to watch the little girls. He had an eye for the
gentle sex even when their fairness was disguised
by dirty pinafores and stiff pigtails. I did not
see what happened, but above the noise of the
organ I heard first, shouts of derision and anger,
and then my brother's voice crying out in pain.</p>

<p>I pushed aside the clinging Seraph and ran to
where I saw the two groups melted into one about
a pair of combatants. The little girls parted
to let me through. I saw then that the contending
parties were Angel and a boy whose
tousled head was fully six inches above my
brother's. He had gripped Angel by the back
of the neck with one hand, while with the other
he struck blows that sounded horrible to me.
Angel was hitting out wildly. When the boy
saw me, he hooked his leg behind Angel's and
threw him on his back with deadly ease, at the
same time administering a kick in the stomach.
He turned then to me with a leer.</p>

<p>"Well, pretty," he simpered, "does yer want
some too? I s'y fellers, 'ere's another Hangel
comin' fer 'is dose. Put up yer little 'ooks then;
an' I'll give yer two black 'osses an' a red driver!
Aw, come on, sissy!"</p>

<p>I tried to remember what father had said
about fighting. "Don't clutch and don't paw.
Strike out from the shoulder like a gentleman."
So, while the boy was talking, I struck out from
the shoulder right on the end of his nose with
my shut fist.</p>

<p>Whatever things I may achieve, never, ah,
never shall I experience a thrill of triumph equal
to that which made my blood dance when I saw
a trickle&mdash;a goodly, rich red trickle!&mdash;of blood
spurt from the bully's nose.</p>

<p>"Ow! Ow! Wesley! Oo's got a red
driver on 'is own?" shouted his comrades.
"Plug aw'y little 'un!"</p>

<p>He snarled horribly, showing his big front
teeth. I could feel his breath hot on my face as
he clutched me round the neck. I could see some
boys holding Angel back, I could hear The
Seraph's wail of "John! John!" Then, simultaneously
there came a blow on my own nose, and
a grasping of my collar, and a shaking that freed
us of each other, for I was clutching him with
fury equal to his own.</p>

<p>A minute passed before I could regain possession
of myself. The street reeled, the organ
seemed to be grinding in my own head, and yet
I found that it was not playing at all, for there
was Tony with it on his back, looking anxiously
into my face, and firing a volley of invective after
the big boy, who was retreating with his mates.</p>

<p>I looked up at the owner of the hand which
still held my collar. He was a very thin young
man with a pale face and quiet grey eyes.</p>

<p>Tony began to offer incoherent explanations.</p>

<p>"But who are they?" demanded the young
man, "they don't seem to belong to this street."</p>

<p>"No, no, no," reiterated Tony, "dey are little
fr-riends of mine&mdash;dey come for a walk with
me. Oh, I shall get into some trouble for dis,
I tink! It was all dose damn boys dat bully
heem, an' when I would run to help, dere was
my Anita lef' on da organ, an' I mus' not lose
her!"</p>

<p>"It's all right," I explained to the young man,
"we were just spending the afternoon with Tony,
and it wasn't his fault we got to fighting, and&mdash;and
did I do very badly please? Did you notice
whether I pawed or not?"</p>

<p>"By George!" said the young man, "you made
the claret flow!"</p>

<p>"It took two of them to hold me or I'd have
got back at him," said Angel.</p>

<p>"It took fwee o' them to hold <i>me</i>," piped
The Seraph, "or I'd have punched evwybody!"</p>

<p>"How did it start?" enquired the young man.</p>

<p>"That biggest one asked me my name," replied
Angel, "and before I thought I'd said,
'Angel,' and that started them. Of course my
real name is David, but I forgot for the moment."</p>

<p>"Pet names <i>are</i> a nuisance sometimes," said
the young man, smiling, "I had one once. It
was John Peel. But no one calls me that now."</p>

<p>"I will tak' dem home now," interrupted Tony.
"Come," taking The Seraph's hand, "dere will
be no more running da street for you little boys!"</p>

<p>"I'll walk along, too," said the young man,
"I've nothing else to do."</p>

<p>I strode along at his side greatly elated. I
was as hot as fire, and some of the gamin's
blood was still on my hand. I cherished it
secretly.</p>

<p>Although the young man had quiet, even sad,
eyes, it turned out that he was wonderfully interesting.
He had travelled considerably, and
had even visited South America, yet he could not
have been an engineer like father, building railroads,
for he looked very poor.</p>

<p>I was sorry when we reached Mrs. Handsomebody's
front door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said, holding out his hand.</p>

<p>But a happy thought struck me. I told him
about Mary Ellen's party. "And," I hurried
on, "there'll be oysters and coffee and all sorts
of good things to eat, and we'd like most awfully
to have you join us if you will. Mary Ellen
would be proud to entertain a friend of ours.
Wouldn't she Angel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and Tony can come too!" cried Angel.
"We'll have a <i>regular</i> party!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will come to da party," said Tony,
quickly, "I am vera hungry. You will egsplain
to Mees Marie Ellen, yes?"</p>

<p>"John can 'splain <i>anything</i>," put in The
Seraph.</p>

<p>"Oh, please come!" I pleaded, dragging the
young man down the side passage. He suffered
himself to be led as far as the back entrance,
but, once there, he halted.</p>

<p>"Tony and I shall wait here," he said, "and
you'll go in and send your Mary Ellen out to
inspect us. We shall see what she thinks of
such a surprise party before we venture in, eh,
Tony?" He gave a queer little laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Tony, "I will leave da organ
out sida, but Anita mus' come in. She is vera
good monk in a party."</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>We three entered breathlessly. Who can describe
the babble of our explanations and appeals
to Mary Ellen's hospitality, and her reproaches
for the fright we had given her? Howbeit,
when the first clamour subsided, we perceived
that Mary Ellen's Mr. Watlin was ensconced
behind the stove, looking tremendously dressed
up and embarrassed. He now came forward
and shook each of us by the hand, quite enveloping
our little paws in a great expanse of warm thick
flesh, smelling of scented soap.</p>

<p>The greetings over, Mary Ellen and he conferred
for a moment in the corner, then Mr.
Watlin creaked across the kitchen on tiptoe (I
fancy he could not yet bring himself to believe
in Mrs. Handsomebody's entire absence from
the house) and disappeared through the outer
door into the yard where the young man and
Tony and Anita waited.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mary Ellen, sternly, "ye've just
got to abide by Mr. Watlin's decision. If he
says they're passable, why, in they come, an' if
he gives 'em their walkin' ticket, well an' good,
an' not a squeak out o' ye. I've had about
enough o' yer actions for wan day!"</p>

<p>"But he's a gentleman, Mary Ellen!" I insisted.</p>

<p>"Ay, an' the monkey's a lady, no doubt! I
know the kind!" I had never seen Mary Ellen
so sour.</p>

<p>But our fears for our friends were set at rest,
for at that instant, the door opened and Mr.
Watlin entered, followed by the young man and
Tony, with Anita perching on his shoulder.
Mary Ellen could not refrain from a broad
smile at the spectacle. The kitchen was filled
with delightful odours. The spirits of everyone
seemed to rise at a bound.</p>

<p>"Good-evening to ye, Tony," said Mary Ellen,
and then she turned to our new friend.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you call yourself, sir," she
said, bluntly.</p>

<p>"You may call me Harry, if you will," he replied,
after a slight hesitation.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen, with a keen look at him, said,
"Won't you sit down, sir? The victuals will be
on the table in the dining-room directly. Mr.
Watlin, would ye mind givin' me a hand with
them dish-covers?"</p>

<p>Mr. Watlin assisted Mary Ellen deftly, and
with an air of proprietorship. He was a stout
young man with a blond pompadour, and a
smooth-shaven ruddy face. As soon as an opportunity
offered, I asked him whether he had
brought his fiddle. He smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"You shall see wot you shall see, and 'ear wot
you shall 'ear," he replied.</p>

<p>In time the great tureen (Mrs. Handsomebody's
silver plated one) was on the table and
the guests were bidden to "sit in." Mary Ellen,
full of dignity, seated herself in Mrs. Handsomebody's
place behind the coffee urn, while Mr.
Watlin drew forward the heavy armchair, which
since the demise of Mr. Handsomebody, had
been occupied by no one save the Unitarian minister
when he took tea with us. Angel and The
Seraph and I were ranged on one side of the table,
and Tony and Harry on the other. Anita sat
on the chair behind Tony, and every now and
again she would push her head under his arm
and peer shyly over the table, or reach with a
thin little claw toward a morsel of food he was
raising to his mouth.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to conceive of seven
people with finer appetites, or of a hostess more
determined that her guests should do themselves
injury from over-eating. Although two of our
company were unexpected, there was more than
enough for every one. The oysters were followed
by a Bedfordshire pudding, potatoes, cold
ham, celery, several sorts of pastry, oranges and
coffee. It was when we reached the lighter portion
of the feast that tongues were unloosed,
and conviviality bloomed like an exotic flower in
Mrs. Handsomebody's dining-room.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen placed a plateful of scraps on the
floor before Anita.</p>

<p>She said, "That ought to stand to her, pore
thing! She do be awful ganted."</p>

<p>"These 'ere fancies is wot tikes me," said Mr.
Watlin, helping himself to his third lemon turnover.
"Sub-stantial food is all right. I
shouldn't care to do without meat and the like,
but it's the fancies that seems to tickle all the
w'y down. Sub-stantial foods is like hugs, but
fancies might come under the 'ead of kisses&mdash;you
don't know when you get enough on 'em,
hey Tony? You lika da kiss?"</p>

<p>Tony turned up his palms.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, dey are not for a poor fella lak
me!"</p>

<p>"Watlin," said Harry, "did you say you were
a Kent man?"</p>

<p>"Ay, from Kent, the garden of England."</p>

<p>"Are you related to Carrot Bill Watlin, then?"</p>

<p>"Carrot Bill!" shouted Mr. Watlin, "Carrot
Bill! Am I related to 'im? W'y 'e's my uncle,
'e is! And do you know 'im then?"</p>

<p>"I've seen him hundreds of times," said Harry.</p>

<p>"There never was such a feller as Carrot Bill,"
said Mr. Watlin, turning to us, "there ain't nobody
in Kent can bunch carrots like 'im. W'y,
truck-men from all over the county brings their
carrots to Bill to be bunched, afore they tikes
'em to Covent Garden Market! 'E trims 'em
down just so, an' fits 'em together till you'd think
they'd growed in bunches. An' they look that
'andsome that they bring a penny more a bunch.
An' to fancy you know 'im&mdash;well I never! Wot
nime was it you said?"</p>

<p>"Harry."</p>

<p>"Ow, I meant your surnime."</p>

<p>"Smith," said Harry, shortly.</p>

<p>"Smith," meditated Mr. Watlin, "I know
several Smiths in Kent. You're likely one on
'em. Well, I must shake 'ands with you for the
sake of Carrot Bill." He reached across the
table and grasped Harry's hand in a hearty
shake. Thereupon we drank a health to Carrot
Bill in bottled beer; and this was followed by a
toast to Mrs. Handsomebody, which somehow
subdued us a little.</p>

<p>"'Er brother is dead you s'y," reflected Mr.
Watlin, "and 'ow hold a man might 'e be?"</p>

<p>"Blessed if I know," replied Mary Ellen, "but
he was years an' years younger than her. She
brought him up, and from what I can find out,
he turned out pretty bad."</p>

<p>"Tck, tck." Mr. Watlin was moved. "It
was very sad for the lidy, but 'e's dead now,
poor chap! We must speak no ill of the dead."</p>

<p>"It's a vewy bad fing to be dead," interposed
The Seraph, sententiously, "you can't eat, you
can't dwink, an' you just fly 'wound an' 'wound,
lookin' for somefing to light on!"</p>

<p>"Right-o, young gentleman!" said Mr. Watlin,
"and put as couldn't be better. And the
moral is, mike the most of our time wot's left!"</p>

<p>"Well, fer my part," sighed Mary Ellen, "I've
et so hearty, I feel like as though I'd a horse settin'
on my stomick! Sure I don't know how to
move."</p>

<p>"A little pinch of bi-carbonate of soder will
hease that, my dear," said her lover.</p>

<p>"Please, <i>did</i> you bring your fiddle, Mr. Watlin?"
pleaded Angel, "won't you play now?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I lof da fiddle!" said Tony, caressing
Anita's little head.</p>

<p>Mr. Watlin, thus importuned, disappeared for
a space into the back hall, whence he finally
emerged in his shirt sleeves, carrying the violin
under his arm. We drew our chairs together
at one end of the room, and watched him as he
tuned the instrument, frowning sternly the while.</p>

<p>"Lydies and gentleman," said he, "I 'ope
you'll pardon me appearing before you in my
waistcoat. I must not be 'ampered you see, wen
I manipulate the bow. I must 'ave freedom.
It's a grand thing freedom! Ah!"</p>

<p>"He's gone as far as he can go on the fiddle,"
explained Mary Ellen to the company. "Someday
he'll give up the butchering business and take
to music thorough."</p>

<p>Mr. Watlin now, with the violin tucked under
his chin, began to play in a very spirited manner.
Our pulses beat time to lively polka and schottische
while Mr. Watlin tapped on the carpet
with his large foot as he played. Mary Ellen
was wild for a dance, she said.</p>

<p>"Get up and 'ave a gow, then," encouraged
Mr. Watlin, "you and 'Arry there!" But she,
for some reason, would not, and Harry was not
urgent.</p>

<p>"I can play da fiddle a little," said Tony, as
our artist paused for a rest.</p>

<p>Mr. Watlin clapped him good-humouredly on
the shoulder. "Go to it then, my boy, give us
your little tune! I'm out of form tonight, anyw'y."
He pushed the violin patronizingly into
Tony's brown hands.</p>

<p>The Italian took it, oh, so lovingly, and, with
an apologetic glance at Mr. Watlin, he tuned
the strings to a different pitch. Anita climbed
to the back of his neck.</p>

<p>Then came music, flooding, trickling, laughing,
from the bow of Tony! Italy you could see;
and little, half-naked children, playing in the
sleepy street! You could hear the tinkle of
donkey bells, and the cooing of pigeons; you could
see Tony's home as he was seeing it, and hear his
sisters singing. It was Spring in Tuscany.</p>

<p>The theme grew sad. It sang of loneliness.
A lost child was wandering through the forest,
who could not find his mother. It was very
dark beneath the fir trees, and the wind made
the boy shiver. His cry of&mdash;Mother!
Mother! echoed in my heart and would not be
hushed. I hid my face in the hollow of my arm
and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>The music ceased. Harry had me in his arms.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, old fellow, was it something
in Tony's music that hurt?"</p>

<p>I nodded, clinging to him.</p>

<p>"It's 'igh time 'e was in bed," said Mr. Watlin,
taking the fiddle brusquely from the Italian's
hands, "'e don't fancy doleful ditties, an' no more
do I, hey Johnnie?"</p>

<p>Tony only smiled at me. "I tink you like my
music," he said.</p>

<p>Harry now announced rather hurriedly that
he must be going, and after he had said good-night
to every one, and thanked Mary Ellen in a
very manly way, he still kept my hand in his,
and, together, we passed out of doors.</p>

<p>It was frosty cold. The air came gratefully
to my hot cheeks. Harry stared up at the stars
in silence for a moment, then he said:</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something, John, before
I go. I don't know just how to make you understand.
But I&mdash;I'm not the loafer you think I
am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No one but a loafer or a sponge would do
what I've done tonight," he persisted, "but I
came here because I like you little chaps so well&mdash;and&mdash;because&mdash;I
was so infernally hungry.
I hadn't eaten since last night, you know, and
when I heard about the oysters and coffee, I just
couldn't refuse, and&mdash;I came."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," I said, "I'm sorry, Harry!
I like you awfully!"</p>

<p>I gave him my hand and, hearing the voices
of Mr. Watlin and Tony, he hurried to the street.</p>

<p>I stumbled sleepily into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Och, do go to bed, Masther John!" exclaimed
Mary Ellen, "you're as white as a cloth!
Well, if you're sick tomorrow, ye must jist grin
an' bear it! An' sure we <i>have</i> had a day of it,
haven't we? Thim oysters was the clane thing!"</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>She followed us to the foot of the stairs with
a lamp. The shadows of the bannisters raced
up the wall ahead of us, as she moved away.
The Seraph gripped the back of my blouse. We
stopped at the door of Mrs. Handsomebody's
bedroom. Like Mrs. Handsomebody, it towered
above us, pale and forbidding.</p>

<p>"I dare you," said Angel, "to open it and stick
your head in."</p>

<p>I was too drowsy to be timid. I turned the
handle and opened the door far enough to insert
my round tow head.</p>

<p>The room was unutterably still. A pale bluish
light filtered through the long white curtains.
The ghostly bed awaited its occupant. The door
of a tall wardrobe stood open&mdash;did something
stir inside? I withdrew my head and closed
the door. Now I remembered that the room
had smelled of black kid gloves. I shuddered.</p>

<p>"You were afraid!" jeered Angel.</p>

<p>"Not I. It was nothing to do."</p>

<p>But when we were safe in bed and Mary Ellen
had come and put out our light, I lay a-thinking
of the empty room. Strange, when people went
away and left you, how Something stayed behind!
A shadowy, wistful something, that
smelled of kid gloves!</p>

<p>We slept till ten next morning. Mary Ellen
superintended our baths. We were in a state
to behold, she said, and she was apprehensive
lest Mrs. Handsomebody should observe my
swollen nose, for the big boy's fist had somewhat
enlarged that unobtrusive feature.</p>

<p>"Jist say ye've a bit of feverish cold if she
remarks it," she cautioned, "people often swells
up wid colds."</p>

<p>We ate our bread and strawberry jam and milk
from one end of the dining table. We heaped
the bread with sugar, and stirred the jam into
our milk. After breakfast, we played at knights
and robbers in the schoolroom. It was a raw
morning, and a Scotch mist dimmed the window
pane.</p>

<p>Angel and I were in the midst of a terrific fight
over a princess whom he was bearing off to his robber
cave (The Seraph, draped in a chenille table-cover,
impersonating the princess) when we were
interrupted by the tinkle of the dinner bell.</p>

<p>How the morning had flown! Had she returned
then? Was the funeral over? Had she
heard our shouts? We descended the stairs with
some misgivings and entered the dining-room in
single file.</p>

<p>Yes, she was there, standing by the table, her
black dress looking blacker than ever! After
a dry little kiss on each of our foreheads, she
motioned us to seat ourselves, and took her own
accustomed place behind the tea things. There
was a solemn click of knives and forks. Mary
Ellen waited on us primly. It was not to be
thought that this was the same room in which
we had feasted so uproariously on the night
previous.</p>

<p>Yet I stared at Mrs. Handsomebody and marvelled
that she should suspect nothing. Did she
get no whiff of the furry smell of Anita? Did
no faint echo of Tony's music disturb her
thoughts? What were her thoughts? Deep
ones I was sure, for her brow was knit. Was
she thinking of that brother on whom the Scotch
mist was falling so remorselessly?</p>

<p>The Seraph was speaking.</p>

<p>"It's a vewy bad fing to be dead," he was saying
reminiscently&mdash;, "you can't eat, you can't
dwink, an' you jus' fly awound lookin' for somefing
to light on!"</p>

<p>I trembled for him, but Mrs. Handsomebody,
lost in thought, gave no heed to him.</p>

<p>At last she raised her eyes.</p>

<p>"I hope you behaved yourselves well, and made
profitable use of your time during my absence?"</p>

<p>We made incoherent murmurs of assent.</p>

<p>"Name the Channel Islands, John."</p>

<p>"Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, Sark, and
Herm," I replied glibly. So much had I saved
from the wreck of things ordained.</p>

<p>"Correct. Are you through your dinners
then? You may pass out. Ah, your nose, John;
it looks quite red. What caused that?"</p>

<p>I said that I believed I had an inward burning
fever. I had embellished Mary Ellen's suggestion.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not going to be ill," she
sighed.</p>

<p>It was not until Angel and I were back in the
schoolroom, that we discovered the absence of The
Seraph. We turned surprised looks on each
other. Our junior seldom left our heels.</p>

<p>"I remember now," reflected Angel, "that, as
he passed her, she stopped him. I didn't think
anything of it. What can she have found out?
D'you s'pose she's pumping the kid?"</p>

<p>We were left to our conjectures for fully a
quarter of an hour. Then we heard him plodding
leisurely up the stairs. We greeted him
impatiently.</p>

<p>"What's up? Did you blab? Whatever <i>did</i>
she say?" We hurled the questions at him.</p>

<p>The Seraph maintained an air of calm superiority.
He even hopped from one floral wreath
on the carpet to another, with his hands behind
his back, as was his custom when he wished to
reflect undisturbed. He ignored our importunities.</p>

<p>Angel, in exasperation, took him by the collar.</p>

<p>"You tell us why she kept you down there so
long!"</p>

<p>Thus cornered, The Seraph raised his large eyes
to our inquiring faces with great solemnity.</p>

<p>"She kept me," he said, "to cuddle me, an'
to give me this&mdash;" he showed a white peppermint
lozenge between his little teeth.</p>

<p>To <i>cuddle</i> him. Was the world coming to an
end?</p>

<p>"Yes," he persisted, "she kept me to cuddle
me, an' she was cwyin'&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody crying!</p>

<p>"It's about her dead brother, of course,"
said Angel. "That's why she cried."</p>

<p>"No," said The Seraph, stoutly. "He was a
<i>man</i>, an' she was cwyin' about a little <i>wee</i> boy
like me, she used to cuddle long ago!"</p>

<h2><i><a name="ch6">Chapter VI: D'ye Ken John
Peel?</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Probably a little boy is never quite so happy
as when he is worshipping and imitating a young
man. From this time on my hero was Harry,
about whom so fascinating an air of mystery
hung that his lightest word was something to be
treasured. I pictured him, hungry and alone,
perhaps brooding over the Collect for next Sunday,
or something of equal melancholy. I was
always on the watch for his tall, slender figure,
when we took our walks, but when we did meet
again, it came as a surprise, and quite took me
off my feet.</p>

<p>A month had passed since Mary Ellen's party.
It was a windy, sunny day in March, and great
white clouds billowed in a clear sky&mdash;like clean
clothes in a tub of blueing, Mary Ellen had said.
I was sitting alone on the steps of the Cathedral.
Angel was in the schoolroom writing his weekly
letter to father, and The Seraph was suffering
a bath at the hands of Mary Ellen, following an
excursion into the remoter depths of the coal
cellar.</p>

<p>So I sat on the Cathedral steps alone. It was
a fine morning for flights of the imagination.
The soft thunder of the Cathedral organ became
at my will the booming of the surf on a distant
coral reef. The pigeons wheeling overhead became
gulls, whimpering in the cordage. Little
did the ancient caretaker reck, as he swept the
stretch of flagging before the carved door, that he
was washing off the deck of a frigate, whilst I, the
rover of the seas, kept a stern eye on him.
Louder boomed the surf&mdash;then soft again. The
door behind me had opened and closed. The
deck-washer touched his cap. Then the Bishop
stood above me, smiling, the sun glinting in his
blue eyes and on the buttons of his gaiters.</p>

<p>"Hal-<i>lo</i>, John," he said. "What's the game
this morning. Seafaring as usual?"</p>

<p>I nodded, "She's as saucy a frigate," I answered
happily, "as ever sailed the seas, and this
here wild weather is just a frolic for her. But
I don't like the look of yon black craft to the
windward." And I pointed to a dustman's cart
that had just hove into view.</p>

<p>"I entirely agree with you," replied the Bishop.
"She looks as though she were out on dirty business.
I'd like nothing better than to stay and see
you make short work of her, but here it is Friday morning, and not a blessed word of my sermon
written, so I must be getting on." And with
that he strode down the street to his own house.
I was alone again watching the approaching vessel
with suspicion. Then, above the thrashing of
the spray, I heard my name spoken by a voice
I knew, and turning looked straight up into
Harry's face.</p>

<p>"John!" he repeated. "What luck. I have
been watching for you for days, you little hermit!"</p>

<p>"Watching for me, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he proceeded, "and the one time I saw
you, that starched governess of yours had you
gripped by the hand&mdash;"</p>

<p>&mdash;"just like any old baby girl," I broke in.</p>

<p>Harry laughed and shook my hand enthusiastically.
I saw that he was even thinner than
before. Was he, I wondered, "infernally hungry"
at this very minute?</p>

<p>"John," he said, looking into my eyes: "You
can help me if you will. We're friends, aren't
we?"</p>

<p>I let him see that I was all on fire to help him,
and it was then that he made his wonderful suggestion.</p>

<p>"Would it be possible to evade your governess
long enough to come and have a bite with
me?"</p>

<p>Dinner with Harry! In his own room! What
an adventure to repeat to Angel and The Seraph!
Without further parley I set off down Henwood
street at a trot lest Mrs. Handsomebody should
spy me from her bedroom window, in a fateful
way she had. Harry hurried after me, catching
my arm and drawing me close to him.</p>

<p>"What a plucky little shaver you are, John,"
he said. "I know she's a corker, but I think you
and I are a match for her, eh?"</p>

<p>I strode beside him breathless. I felt taller,
stronger, than ever before. By contrast with our
masculinity Mrs. Handsomebody seemed a rather
pitiful old woman.</p>

<p>We spoke little, but hurried through many
streets, till, at last, we came to the narrow dingy
one where I had first seen Harry. We turned
down an alley beside a green grocer's shop and
entered a narrow doorway into the strangest
passage I had ever seen.</p>

<p>It was damp and chill. The floor was paved
with dark red bricks and the walls were stone.
On our left I glimpsed a dim closet where a
woman with fat arms was dipping milk out of
what looked like a zinc-covered box. On our
right rose the steepest, most winding staircase imaginable;
and close to the wall beside the stairs
towered a giant grapevine whose stem was as
thick as a man's arm. After an eccentric curve
or two, this amazing vine disappeared through a
convenient hole in the roof. I was lost in admiration
and should have liked to stop and examine
it, but Harry urged me up the stairs.</p>

<p>"How is that for steep?" he demanded, at the
top. "Winded, eh? Now these are my digs,
John&mdash;" and he threw open a door with a flourish.</p>

<p>It was a shabby little room with a threadbare
carpet, yet it wore an air of adventure somehow.
The lamp shade had a daring tilt to it; the blind
had been run up askew; and the red table cover
had been pushed back to make room for a mound
of books. Harry's bed looked as though he had
been having a pillow fight. Surely not with the
fat lady downstairs.</p>

<p>Harry was clearing the table by tossing the
books into the middle of the bed. "We're going
to have tea directly," he explained. "Can't you
hear her puffing up the stairs? I expect a catastrophe
every time she does it." He set two chairs
at the table and gazed eagerly at the doorway.</p>

<p>She appeared at last with heaving bosom carrying
a large tray, and began to lay the table. I
observed with great interest that she was placing
a whole kidney for each of us, and that there were
also potato chips and six jam puffs. Harry bade
me sit down with the air of one who entertains a
guest of importance; I swelled with pride as I attacked
the kidney.</p>

<p>Harry, sitting opposite, eating with a gusto
equal to my own, seemed to me the most perfect
and luckiest of mortals.</p>

<p>"Harry!" I got it out through my mouth full
of potato chips, "Harry, I say! Do you always
have jolly things like these to eat?"</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my John! On the contrary there are
many times when I do not eat at all. However,
I paid a visit to an uncle of mine yesterday, who
gave me so much money that I shall live well for
some time to come, but&mdash;I shall never know the
time o'day."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's fine&mdash;" I cried, "Not to know
the time! I wish I didn't for it's always time to
go to bed, or do lessons, or take a tiresome walk
with Mrs. Handsomebody."</p>

<p>Harry stared hard at me. "What do you suppose,"
he asked, "she'll do to you, for skipping
dinner? Something pretty hot?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," I returned. "It's a new sort of
badness. P'raps I'll have to do without tea, or
maybe she'll write to father&mdash;she's always threatening.
Don't let's talk about it."</p>

<p>"She appears to be a rather poisonous old
party," commented Harry. "I see that it behooves
me to get to business and tell you just why
I brought you here." He pushed back his plate
and took from his pocket a short thick pipe and
lighted it.</p>

<p>"Now John," he smiled, "just finish up those
jam puffs. Don't leave one, or my landlady will
eat it, and she has double chins enough. I want
to talk to you as man to man."</p>

<p>Man to man! How I wished that Angel could
see me, being made the confidant of Harry! I
helped myself to my third jam puff with an air of
cool deliberation.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;" Harry leant across the table, his
eyes on mine, "What sort of looking man would
you expect my father to be, John?"</p>

<p>I studied Harry and hazarded&mdash;"A brown
face, and awfully thin, and greenish eyes, and
crinkly brown hair."</p>

<p>"Wrong!" cried Harry, smiting the table.
"My father's got a full pink face, the bluest of
eyes and a fine head of white hair, which, I am
afraid I helped to whiten, worse luck!"</p>

<p>"He sounds nice," I commented.</p>

<p>"He is. Now what do you suppose my father
<i>does</i>, John?"</p>

<p>"Not a <i>pirate</i>!" but I said it hopefully.</p>

<p>"Far from it. He's a bishop."</p>

<p>"Hurray!" I cried. "Our best friend is a
bishop. He lives right next door to us."</p>

<p>"The very man," said Harry. "He's my
father."</p>

<p>I was incredulous.</p>

<p>"But he's only got his niece, Margery, and his
butler, and his cook! The cook's awfully good
to him. Makes his favorite pudding any day he
wants it."</p>

<p>"Ay, but he's got me too," said Harry solemnly,
"or, at least, he <i>should</i> have me. We're
at the outs."</p>

<p>"Well, then, all you have to do is to make
friends, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not so simple as it sounds," replied Harry
gloomily.</p>

<p>"I have been a bad son to him." He rose abruptly
and began walking up and down the room.
I got to my feet too, and strode beside him,
hands deep in pockets. I longed for a short
thick pipe.</p>

<p>"I never did what he wanted me to," pursued
Harry. "He wanted me to stick at college and
make something of myself, but all I cared to do
was to knock about with chaps who weren't good
for me, and I simply wouldn't study. So we had
words. Hot ones too. I left home with a little
money my mother had left me. I was twenty-one
then&mdash;five years ago." He looked down in my
face with his sudden smile. "You're a rum little
toad," he said. "I like to talk to you, John."</p>

<p>I thought: "When I'm a man I'll have a pipe
like that, and hold it in my teeth when I talk."</p>

<p>Harry sat down on the side of his tumbled bed
clasping an ankle.</p>

<p>"For three years," he went on, "I knocked
about from one country to another seeing the
world, till at last all my money was gone. Then
I came back to England but I wouldn't go to my
father until I had done something that would
justify myself&mdash;make him proud of me. It
seemed to me that I could become a great actor
if I had a chance. Very well. After a lot of
waiting and disappointments I got an engagement
with a third rate company that travelled
mostly on one-night stands&mdash;you understand?</p>

<p>"I have been at it ever since, playing all sorts
of parts&mdash;companies breaking up without salaries
being paid&mdash;then another just as bad&mdash;cheap
lodgings&mdash;bad food&mdash;and long stretches of being
out of a job altogether. I am that way now.
I have only seen my father once in all this time.
It was simply&mdash;well&mdash;" He gave his funny
smile and shook his head ruefully.</p>

<p>I leaned over the foot of the bed staring
expectantly.</p>

<p>"We had arrived one Sunday morning in a
small town, and were trailing wearily down the
street just as the people were going to morning
service. Suddenly, as I was passing a large
church, I saw my father alight from the carriage
at the door. I found out afterwards that he
had come to conduct a special service. He was
so near that I could have touched him, but I just
stood, rooted to the spot, so beastly ashamed
you know, with my shabby travelling bag behind
me, and my heart pounding away like Billy-ho!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish he'd seen you!" I cried, "he'd
have made it up like a shot."</p>

<p>Harry blew a great cloud of smoke. "Well,
I want to sneak back to him, John&mdash;but&mdash;here's
the rub&mdash;<i>perhaps Margery does not want me</i>."
He sucked gloomily at his pipe for a bit in silence,
then taking it from his mouth he stabbed at me
with the stem of it.</p>

<p>"This is where you come in my friend. You'd
like to help, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>I nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>"This, then, is what I want you to do. Find
Margery this afternoon and say to her: 'Margery,
I've met your cousin Harry. Would you
like to have him come home again?' Watch her
face then&mdash;you're a shrewd little fellow&mdash;and if
she looks happy and pleased about it you must
let me know, but if she looks glum and as if her
plans had been upset, you must tell me just the
same. Never mind what she says, watch her
face. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" We shook hands on it.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" I asked, "when shall I see you? I
daren't come here again, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow is Saturday," he replied thoughtfully.
"The Bishop will keep to his study till
noon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Handsomebody goes to market!"
I chimed in.</p>

<p>"Good. I'll be at the Cathedral corner at ten
o'clock. Meet me there. Now you'd better cut
home."</p>

<p>He took my arm and led me down the strange
winding stairway, through the cool damp passage
where the grapevine grew, to the sunken doorstep.</p>

<p>"Know your way home?" he demanded.
"Right-o! I depend on you, John. And mind
you watch her face, <i>like a cat</i>. Good-bye!"
And he affectionately squeezed my arm.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>I set off as fast as my legs could carry me;
and the nearer home I drew, the greater became
my fear of Mrs. Handsomebody. What would
she say? Dinner would be over long ago I knew.
My steps began to lag as I reached the Cathedral
corner. The great grey pile usually so friendly
now rose before me gloomily. Inside, the organ
boomed like an accusing voice. My heart sank.
Mrs. Handsomebody's house with the blinds
drawn three-quarters of the way down the windows
seemed to watch my approach with an air
of cold cynicism.</p>

<p>Softly I turned the door-knob and entered the
dim hall. All was quiet, a quiet pervaded by
the familiar smell of old fabrics, bygone meals,
and umbrellas. The white door of the parlour
towered like a ghost. I put my arm across my
eyes and began to cry.</p>

<p>At first I only snivelled, but surrendered myself
after a few successful ventures, to a loud despairing
roar.</p>

<p>I could see the blurred image of Mrs. Handsomebody
standing at the top of the stairs. I
heard her sharp command to mount them instantly,
and I began to grope my way up, hanging
by the bannister.</p>

<p>When I had gained the top, her angular hand
grasped my shoulder and pushed me before her,
into the schoolroom. The Seraph's eyes were
large with sympathy, but Angel grinned maliciously.
Our governess seated herself beside her
desk and placed me in front of her.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, in a voice of cold anger,
"will <i>you</i> be good enough to explain your strange
conduct? Where have you been all this while?"</p>

<p>"Sittin' on the Cathedral steps," I sobbed.</p>

<p>"That is a falsehood, John. Twice I sent
David to search for you there and both
times he reported that you were nowhere
in sight. <i>Where were you?</i> Answer truthfully
or it will be the worse for you."</p>

<p>"I h-hid when I saw him comin'," I stammered,
"I was too s-sick to come home." Surely
this would affect her!</p>

<p>She stared incredulously. "Sick! Where are
you sick?"</p>

<p>"All o-ver."</p>

<p>"Take your hand from your eyes. What
made you sick?"</p>

<p>"I f-fell."</p>

<p>"Fell!" her tone was contemptuous. "Where
did you fall?"</p>

<p>"D-down."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody became ironical.</p>

<p>"How <i>extraordinary</i>! I have never heard of
people falling up."</p>

<p>"They can fall out," interrupted Angel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody rapped her ruler in his
direction.</p>

<p>"Silence!" she gobbled. "Not another word
from you." Then, turning to me&mdash;"You say
that you fell down, hurt yourself, and have since
been in hiding. Now tell me <i>precisely</i> what happened
from the moment that you ventured beyond
the bounds I have prescribed for you."</p>

<p>There was no use in hedging. I saw that there
was nothing for it but to drown this woman out;
so I raised my voice and drowned her out.</p>

<p>My next sensation was that of a scuffle, several
sharp smacks with the ruler, and at last being
sat down very hard on a chair in our bedroom.
Mrs. Handsomebody was standing in the doorway.
I had never seen her with so high a colour.</p>

<p>"You will remain in that chair," she commanded,
"until tea time. Do not loll on the
bed. And you may rest assured that I shall
leave no stone unturned till I have discovered
every detail of this prank. It is at such times
as these that I regret ever having undertaken
the charge of three such unruly boys. It is only
the high regard in which I hold your father that
makes it tolerable. I hope you will take advantage
of your solitude to review thoroughly
your past."</p>

<p>She closed the door with deliberate forebearance,
then I heard the key click in the lock
and her inexorable retreating footsteps.</p>

<p>I found my wad of a handkerchief and rubbed
my cheeks. I had stopped crying but my
body still was shaken. For a long time I sat
staring straight before me busy with plans for
the afternoon. Then I fell asleep.</p>

<p>A soft thumping on the panel of the door
roused me at last. I felt stiff and rather desolate.</p>

<p>"John!" It was The Seraph's voice. "I say,
John! You should be a dwagon, an' when I
kick on the door you should woar fwightfully."</p>

<p>"Where's <i>she</i>?" 'Twas thus we designated
our governess.</p>

<p>"Gone away out. Will you be a dwagon,
John?"</p>

<p>Obligingly I dropped to my hands and knees
and ambled to the door. The Seraph kicked it
vigorously and I began to roar. I was pleased
to find that so much crying had left my voice
very husky so that I could indeed roar horribly.
The louder The Seraph kicked the louder I
roared. It was exhausting, and I had had about
enough of it when I heard Mary Ellen pounding
up the uncarpeted back stairs.</p>

<p>"If you kick that dure onct more&mdash;" she panted&mdash;"ye
little tormint&mdash;I'll put a tin ear on ye!
As fer you, Masther John, 'tis yersilf has a voice
like young thunder!"</p>

<p>She unlocked the door and threw it wide open;
Angel and The Seraph crowded in after her.
Mary Ellen's sleeves were rolled above her
elbows, her red face was covered with little beads
of perspiration, and she wore large goloshes. A
savour of soap suds, mops, and the corners of old
pantries, emanated from her. She extended to
me a moist palm on which lay a thick slice of
bread spread with cold veal gravy.</p>

<p>"This," said she, "is to stay ye till tea-time;
an' now let me git back to me scrubbin' or the
suds'll be all dried up on me."</p>

<p>But I caught her apron and held her fast.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't go, Mary Ellen!" I begged, "I've
something awfully interesting to tell you. Do
sit down!"</p>

<p>"I will not thin. And you've nothin' to tell
me that I haven't got be heart already."</p>

<p>"But this is about Harry, who had supper with
us and Mr. Watlin and Tony. It's a most surprising
adventure. Just wait and hear." I
dragged her to a chair.</p>

<p>She settled back with a smile of relaxation.
"Aw well," she remarked, "who would be foriver
workin' fer small pay an' little thanks? Out
wid your story my lambie." And she drew The
Seraph on her ample lap.</p>

<p>So while they clustered about me I told my
whole adventure, ending with Harry's plea that
I interview Margery on his behalf.</p>

<p>"It's a 'normous responsibility," I sighed.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," said Mary Ellen, "she'll
want him home fast enough, a fine young gintleman
like him. Now I'm minded of it, their cook
did tell me that the Bishop had a son that was a
regular playboy.</p>

<p>"He's not a playboy," I retorted. "He's
splendid&mdash;and <i>please</i> Mary Ellen, there's something
I want you to do for me. You must let
me go this minute to see Margery and find out
if she wants him back again."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll have him, no fear." This with a
broad smile.</p>

<p>"But I've got to <i>ask</i> her. I promised. It's
a 'normous responsibility. Will you <i>please</i> let
me, Mary El-len?"</p>

<p>"I will not," replied Mary Ellen, firmly.
"It'ud be as much as my place is worth."</p>

<p>I began to cry. Angel came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Be a sport, Mary Ellen. Let him go. I'll
stand at the gate and if I see the Dragon coming,
I'll pass the tip to John, and he can cut over
the garden wall and be in the room before she
gets to the front door."</p>

<p>Mary Ellen threw up her hands. She never
could resist Angel's coaxing. "God save Ireland,"
she groaned, and, dropping The Seraph,
clattered back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The Seraph stood like a rumpled robin where
she had deposited him. He had confided to me
once that he rather liked being nursed by Mary
Ellen, though the heaving of her bosom bothered
him. He was far too polite to tell her this: but
now that she was gone, he hunched his shoulders,
stretched his neck and breathed&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a welief!&mdash;"</p>

<p>I found Margery alone in the drawing-room.
People had just been, for teacups were standing
about, and a single muffin lay in a silver muffin
dish. Even in the stress of my mission its isolation
appealed to me.</p>

<p>Margery was doing something to a bowl of
roses but she looked up, startled at my appearance.</p>

<p>"Why, John!" she exclaimed, "what is the matter
with you? Have you been crying? Your
face is awfully smudgy."</p>

<p>"Sorry," I replied, "I wasn't crying but I'm
on very particular business and I hadn't time to
wash." I went at it, hammer and tongs, then&mdash;"It's
about Harry. He wants to know if you'll
have him home again."</p>

<p>Margery looked just puzzled.</p>

<p>"Harry! Harry who?"</p>

<p>"Your Harry," I replied, manfully. "The
Bishop's Harry." And I poured out the whole
story of my meeting with Harry and his passionate
desire to come home. All the while, I
anxiously watched Margery's face for signs of
joy or disapproval. It was pale and still as the
face of a white moth, but when she spoke her
words fell on my budding hopes like cold rain.
She put her hands on my shoulders and said
earnestly:</p>

<p>"You must tell him not to come, John. It
would be such a great pity! The Bishop is quite,
quite used to being without him now, and it would
upset him dreadfully to try to forgive Harry.
I don't believe he could. And he and I are so
contented. Harry would be very disturbing&mdash;you
see, he's such a restless young man, John;
and he hasn't been at all kind to his father. He's
done&mdash;things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you don't know him!" I interrupted.
"He's splendid!"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>want</i> to know him," Margery persisted.
"He's a very&mdash;"</p>

<p>I could let this thing go no further. Here
was another woman who must be drowned out.
I raised my voice, therefore, and almost
shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, you've got to know him! He's coming
home tomorrow night. At seven. He
wants his bed got ready. So there."</p>

<p>Margery sat down. She got quite red.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me this before?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"'Cos I was breaking it to you gently, like
they do accidents," I answered calmly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Margery began to laugh hysterically.
She pressed her palms against her cheeks and
laughed and laughed. Then she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"John, you're a most extraordinary boy."</p>

<p>I thought so too, but I said, modestly&mdash;"Oh,
well. Somebody had to do it." Then, in the
flush of my triumph I remembered Mrs. Handsomebody.
"But, oh, I say, I must be going!
And&mdash;please&mdash;would it matter much if we were
here to see him come home? We'd be very
quiet."</p>

<p>Margery looked relieved. "I believe it would
help&mdash;" she said. "It will be rather difficult.
Yes, do come. Ask your governess if you may
spend an hour with Uncle and me between your
tea and bedtime. And, oh, John, that muffin
looks wretchedly lonely."</p>

<p>Outside, I divided the spoils with Angel.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" he demanded, his mouth full of
muffin&mdash;"shewanimbagagen?"</p>

<p>"Rather," I cried, joyously. "I managed the
whole thing. And we're to be there at seven to
see him come."</p>

<p>We raced to the kitchen and told Mary Ellen,
who was promptly impressed, but The Seraph
after a close scrutiny of us, said bitterly&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's cwumbs on your faces!"</p>

<p>"Cwumbs on your own face, old sillybilly!"
mocked Angel, "and what's more, they're sugar
cwumbs!"</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>As fate would have it, Mrs. Handsomebody
decreed that I should not leave the house on
Saturday morning, and she, having a spell of
sciatica did not go to market, as usual; so there
I was, unable to meet Harry on the cathedral
steps, as I had promised. It simply meant that
Angel must undertake the mission, while I kicked
my heels in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>He undertook it with a careless alacrity that
was very irritating to one who longed to finish,
in his own fashion, an undertaking that had, so
far, been carried on with masterly diplomacy.</p>

<p>The Seraph went with Angel, and it seemed
a long hour indeed till I heard the longed-for
footsteps hurrying up the stairs. The door was
thrown open, and they burst in rosy and wind-blown.</p>

<p>"It's all right," announced Angel briskly.
"He'll be there sharp at seven, and he's jolly
glad that we're to be there too!"</p>

<p>"And did you tell him?" I asked rather plaintively,
"that I had done the whole thing?"</p>

<p>"Course I did."</p>

<p>"What did he say when you told him he was
to come home?"</p>

<p>"He slapped his leg&mdash;" Angel gave his own
leg a vigorous slap in illustration&mdash;"and said&mdash;'once
aboard the lugger, and the girl is mine!'"</p>

<p>It was a fascinating and cryptic utterance. We
all tried it on varying notes of exultation. It
put zest into what otherwise would have been a
dragging day. By tea-time our legs were sore
with whacking.</p>

<p>Came the hour at last. We set out holding
each other by moist clean hands, an admonishing
Mrs. Handsomebody on the doorsill.</p>

<p>Our hearts were high with excitement when
we were shown ceremoniously into the Bishop's
library, where he and Margery were sitting in
the dancing firelight. We loved the dark-panelled
room where we were always made so
happy. At Mrs. Handsomebody's we could
never do anything right, mugs of milk had a spiteful
way of tilting over on the table-cloth without
ever having been touched, but we could handle
the things in the Chinese cabinet here or play
carpet ball on the rug in the most seemly fashion.</p>

<p>No one could tell stories like the Bishop, and
after we had played for a bit, and The Seraph
had demonstrated, on the hearthrug, how he
could turn a somersault, some one suggested a
story.</p>

<p>I often thought it a pity that those, who only
heard the Bishop preach, should never know how
his great talents were wasted in that r&ocirc;le. It
took the "Arabian Nights" to bring out the deep
thrill of his sonorous voice, and his power of filling
the human heart with delicious fear.</p>

<p>Now we perched about him listening with rapt
eyes to the tale of Ali Baba. We wished there
were more women like the faithful Morgiana with
her pot of boiling oil. The Seraph, especially,
revelled in the thought of those poor devils of
thieves, each simmering away in his own jar.</p>

<p>There fell a silence when the story was
finished, and I was just casting about in my mind
for the next one I should beg, when, Angel, looking
at the clock, suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"Bishop, will you sing? Will you please sing
us a nice old song 'stead of a story? Sing 'John
Peel,' won't you?"</p>

<p>"Please sing 'John Peel'!" echoed The Seraph.</p>

<p>The Bishop seemed loath to sing "John Peel."
It was years since he had sung it, he said; he had
almost forgotten the words. But when Margery
joined her persuasions to ours, he consented
to sing just one verse and the chorus. So
he sang (but rather softly);</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"D'ye ken John Peel, with his coat so grey?</p>
<p class="i2">D'ye ken John Peel, at the break of day?</p>
<p>D'ye ken John Peel, when he's far, far away,</p>
<p class="i2">With his hounds and his horn in the morning?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Before he had time to begin the chorus, it was
taken up by a mellow baritone voice in the hall.
It began softly too, but when it reached the
"View halloo," it rang boldly.</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed,</p>
<p class="i2">And the cry of his hounds, which he oft-times led,</p>
<p>Peel's 'View halloo!' would awaken the dead,</p>
<p class="i2">Or the fox from his lair in the morning."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Bishop never moved a muscle till the last
note died away, then he shook us off him, took
three strides to the door, and swept the curtains
back. Harry stood in the doorway with a rather
shame-faced smile.</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the Bishop.
"Harry!" Then he put his arms around him
and kissed him.</p>

<p>I threw a triumphant glance at Margery. It
hadn't hurt the Bishop at all to forgive Harry.</p>

<p>"It was all the doing of these kids," Harry
was saying, "if they hadn't cleared the way, I'd
never have dared. John engineered everything.
As a diplomat he's a pocket marvel."</p>

<p>He and Margery gave each other a very funny
look. I should like to have heard their later
conversation.</p>

<p>"They're good boys," said the Bishop, with
an arm still around Harry, "capital boys, and
if their governess will let them come to dinner
tomorrow we'll have a sort of party, and talk
everything over. I think cook would make a
blackberry pudding. Will you arrange it Margery?
Just now I want&mdash;" He said no more,
but he and Harry gripped hands.</p>

<p>Margery herded us gently into the hall, and
gave us each two chocolate bars.</p>

<p>Going home under the first pale stars, we were
three rollicking blades indeed. We no longer
held hands, but we hooked arms, and swaggered
and we did not ring the bell till the last vestige of
chocolate was gone.</p>

<p>As we waited for Mary Ellen, I said, suddenly
to Angel:</p>

<p>"Angel, what made you ask the Bishop to sing
'John Peel'? Did you know Harry was going
to sing in the hall?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry and I fixed that up this morning,"
replied my senior, airily. "I kept it to myself,
'cos I didn't want any interference, see?"</p>

<p>Mary Ellen, opening the door at this moment,
prevented a scuffle, though I was in too happy a
mood to quarrel with any one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody was surprisingly civil
about our visit. She showed great interest in
the return of the Bishop's only son. Was he a
nice young man? she asked. Was he nice-looking?
Did the Bishop appear to be overjoyed to
see him?</p>

<p>We three were seated on three stiff-backed
chairs, our backs to the wall. Angel and I told
her as much as was good for her to know of the
adventure.</p>

<p>The Seraph felt that he was being ignored,
so when a pause came, he remarked in that
throaty little voice of his:</p>

<p>"It's a vewy bad fing to be boiled in oil."</p>

<p>"What's that?" snapped Mrs. Handsomebody.
"Say that again!"</p>

<p>"It's a vewy bad fing to be boiled in oil," reiterated
The Seraph suavely, "thirty-nine of 'em
there was&mdash;for the captain was stabbed alweady&mdash;boilin'
away in oil. Their <i>ears was full of it</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody gripped the arms of her
chair, and leaned towards him.</p>

<p>"Alexander, I have never known a child of
such tender years to possess so unquenchable a lust
for frightfulness. It must be eradicated at all
costs."</p>

<p>The Seraph stood, then, balancing himself on
the rung of his chair,</p>

<p>"'Once aboard the lugger,'" he sang out, slapping
his plump little thigh, "'and the gell is
mine!'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody sank back in her chair.
She said:</p>

<p>"This is appalling. David&mdash;John&mdash;take your
little brother to bed instantly! Take him out
of my hearing."</p>

<p>Angel and I each grasped an arm of the reluctant
infant and dragged him from the room. He
stamped up the stairway between us, with an air
of stubborn jollity.</p>

<p>When we had reached the top, he loosed himself
from me and put his head over the handrail.</p>

<p>"'John Peel's View Halloo! would waken the
dead'&mdash;" he roared down into the hall.</p>

<p>But he got no further. Between us we hustled
him into the bedroom, and shut the door. Angel
and I leaned against it, then, in helpless laughter.</p>

<p>In a moment I felt my arm squeezed by Angel,
who was pointing ecstatically toward the bed.</p>

<p>There, by the bedside, his dimpled hands
folded, his curly head meekly bent, knelt The
Seraph.</p>

<p>He was saying his prayers.</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch7">Chapter VII: Granfa</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>At Mrs. Handsomebody's on a Sunday morning
Angel and I had an egg divided between us,
after our porridge. It was boiled rather hard
so that it might not run, and we watched the
cutting of it jealously. The Seraph's infant organs
were supposed not to be strong enough to
cope with even half an egg, so he must needs
satisfy himself with the cap from Mrs. Handsomebody's;
and he made the pleasure endure
by the most minute nibbling, filling up the gaps
with large mouthfuls of toast.</p>

<p>It was at a Sunday morning breakfast that
Mrs. Handsomebody broached the subject of fishing.
Angel and I had just scraped the last
vestige of rubbery white from our half shells,
and, having reversed them in our egg-cups, were
gazing wistfully at what appeared to be two unchipped
eggs, when she spoke.</p>

<p>"You have been invited by Bishop Torrance
to go on a fishing excursion with him tomorrow,
and I have consented; provided, of course, that
your conduct today be most exemplary. What
do you say? Thanks would not be amiss."</p>

<p>Angel and I mumbled thanks, though we were
well nigh speechless with astonishment and joy.
The Seraph bolted his cherished bit of egg whole
and said in his polite little voice:</p>

<p>"He's a vewy nice man to take us fishin'. I
wonder what made him do it."</p>

<p>"I have never pretended," returned Mrs.
Handsomebody, stiffly, "to account for the
vagaries of the male. Yet I grant you it seems
singular that a dignitary of the church should
find pleasure in such a project, in company with
three growing boys."</p>

<p>"If it had been anyone but the Bishop," she
went on, "I should have refused, for there are
untold possibilities of danger in trout fishing.
You must, for example, guard against imbedding
the fish hook in the flesh, which is most painful,
often leading to blood-poisoning. This is
to say nothing of the risk in sitting on damp
grass, or the stings of insects."</p>

<p>"Did you ever sit on the sting of an insect,
please?" questioned The Seraph eagerly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody looked at him sharply.
"One more question of that character," she said,
"and you will remain at home." Then, glancing
around the table, she went on&mdash;"What!
your eggs gone so soon? We shall give thanks
then. Alexander"&mdash;to The Seraph&mdash;"It is your
turn to say grace. Proceed."</p>

<p>The Seraph, with folded hands and bent head,
repeated glibly:</p>

<p>"Accept our thanks, O Lord, for these Thy
good cweatures given to our use, and by them
fit us for Thy service. Amen."</p>

<p>There was a scraping of chairs, and we got to
our feet. The Seraph, holding his bit of egg
shell in his warm little palm asked&mdash;"Is an egg a
cweature, yet?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody gloomed down at him
from her height. "I say it in all solemnity,
Alexander, the natural bent of your mind is toward
the ribald and cynical. I do what I can
to curb it, but I fear for your future." And
she swept from the room.</p>

<p>Eagerly we took our places in the choir stalls
that morning.</p>

<p>The May sunshine had taken on the mellowness
of summer, and it struck fire from the sacred
vessels on the altar, and the brazen-winged eagle
of the lectern. Strange-shaped patterns of wine-colour
and violet were cast from the stained glass
windows upon the walls and pillars, enriching the
grey fabric of the church, like tropic flowers.
The window nearest me was a favourite of ours.
It was dedicated, so saith the bronze tablet beneath,
to the memory of Cosmo John, fifth son
of an Earl of Aberfalden. He had died at the
age of fifteen, not a tender age to me, but the age
toward which I was eagerly straining, the vigourous,
untrammelled age of the big boy.</p>

<p>I stared at the young knight in the red cloak
who, to me, represented Cosmo John, and thought
it a great pity that he should have gone off in
such a hurry, just when life was opening up such
happy vistas before him, vistas no longer patrolled
by governesses and maid servants, nor
hedged in by petty restrictions. Cosmo John had
died one hundred years ago, in May&mdash;and, by the
Rood! this was May! Had he ever been
a-fishing. Had the sudden tremor of the rod
made his young heart to leap? I heard the
Bishop's rich voice roll on:</p>

<p>"&mdash;Most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy
favour to behold our most gracious Sovereign
Lady, Queen Victoria; and so replenish her with
the grace of Thy Holy Spirit that she may alway
incline to Thy will"&mdash;the Bishop's voice became
one with the murmur of the river, as it moved
among the ridges; the mellow sunlight scarcely
touched this sheltered pool, but one could see it
in its full strength on the meadow beyond, where
larks were nesting. I brought myself up with a
start. The Bishop's voice came from a great distance&mdash;"beseech
Thee to bless Albert Edward
Prince of Wales"&mdash;Angel was joggling me with
his elbow.</p>

<p>"You duffer," he whispered, "you've been nodding.
Get your hymn book."</p>

<p>In the choir vestry the Bishop stopped for a
moment beside us, his surplice billowing about him
like the sails about a tall mast when the wind dies.
"At seven," he said, "tomorrow morning at my
house. And <i>wear old clothes</i>."</p>

<p>The sails were filled, and he moved majestically
away, towering above the small craft around him.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>It was morning. It was ten o'clock. It was
May. We were all stowed away in the Bishop's
trap with his son, Harry, controlling the fat pony,
whose small fore-hoof pawed impatiently on the
asphalt. Angel and I had donned old jerseys and
The Seraph a clean holland pinafore, against
which he pressed an empty treacle tin where a
solitary worm reared an anxious head against the
encircling gloom.</p>

<p>"I've got a worm," he gasped, gleefully, as the
pony, released at last, jerked us almost off our
seats. "He's nice an' fat, an' he's quite clean,
for I've washed him fwee times. He's as tame
as anyfing. He's wather a dear ole worm, an' it
seems a shame to wun a hook frew him."</p>

<p>"Child, it shall not be done," consoled the
Bishop. "Keep your worm, and, when we get to
the river-bank, we'll introduce him to the country
worms, and maybe he'll like them so well he'll
marry and settle down there for the rest of his
days."</p>

<p>"If he could see a lady-worm he'd like," stipulated
The Seraph.</p>

<p>"He'd have a wide choice," said the Bishop.
"The country is full of worms, some of them
charming, I daresay."</p>

<p>"And, I say," chuckled Angel, "you could perform
the ceremony&mdash;if only we knew their
names."</p>

<p>"This is Charles Augustus," said The Seraph
with dignity.</p>

<p>"She'd likely be Ernestine," I put in.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Bishop. "It should proceed
thus: 'I, Charles Augustus, take thee,
Ernestine, to have and to hold'&mdash;and I do wish,
Harry, that you'd have a care and hold Merrylegs
in. He's almost taking our breath away.
Such a speed is undignified, and bad for the digestion."</p>

<p>It was true that the fat pony was in amazing
spirits that morning. Shops and houses were
passed with exhilarating speed. To us little
fellows, who always walked with our governess,
when we went abroad, it was intoxicating.</p>

<p>Soon the town was left behind and we were
bowling along a country road past a field where
boys were flying a kite, its long tail making sinuous
curves against the turquoise sky. The air was
sweet with the fresh May showers; and the swift
roll of wheels was an inspiring accompaniment to
our chatter.</p>

<p>Further along lay a tranquil pond in a common,
its surface stirred by a tiny boat with white sails.
An old, white-bearded man in a smock frock was
teaching his grandsons to sail the boat. It must
be jolly, we thought, to have a nice old grandfather
to play with one.</p>

<p>At last we passed a vine-embowered inn, set
among apple trees in bloom. It was "The Sleepy
Angler" and the Bishop said that the river curved
just beyond it.</p>

<p>We gave a shout of joy as we caught the glint
of it; a shout that might well have been a warning
to any lurking trout. Angel and I scarcely waited
for the pony to draw up beneath the trees before
we tumbled out of the trap; and the Bishop,
grasping the eager Seraph by the wrist, swung him
to the ground after us.</p>

<p>We felt very small and light, and almost fairy-like,
as we ran here and thither over the lush
grass, studded with spring flowers. Our sensitive
nostrils were greeted by enticing new odors that
seemed to be pressed from the springy sod of our
scampering feet. The Seraph still clutched the
treacle tin, and Charles Augustus must have had
a bad quarter hour of it.</p>

<p>The stream, which was a sharp, clear one, sped
through flowery meadows, where geese were grazing
as soberly as cows. An old orchard enfolded
it, at last, scattering pink petals on its flowing
cloud-flecked surface, and drawing new life from
its freshness.</p>

<p>Harry made the pony comfortable and lit his
pipe, and the Bishop got ready his tackle, while
the three of us clustered about him, filled with
wonder and delight to see the book of many
coloured flies, and all the intricacies of preparing
the rod and bait. Angel and I were equipped
with proper rods baited with greenish May-flies,
and The Seraph got a willow wand and line at
the end of which dangled an active grasshopper.</p>

<p>"You know," said the Bishop, when we had
cast our flies, "if I were a whole-hearted angler,
I should not have brought three such restless
spirits on this expedition but truly I am&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>'No fisher,</p>
<p>But a well-wisher</p>
<p>To the game!'</p>
</div></div>

<p>So, now that you are here, suppose I give you a
lesson in manipulating your tackling. If you proceed
as you have begun, there will very soon not
be so much as a minnow within a mile of us.
Easy now, Angel; just move your fly gently on top
of the water so that his bright wings may attract
the eye of the most wanton trout. Easy, John&mdash;by
the lord, I've caught a Greyling! And come
and sniff him, and you'll find he smells of water-thyme."</p>

<p>How aptly we took to this sort of teaching,
given in the fresh outdoors, the air pleasant with
honeysuckle, and a lark carolling high above us!
We could scarcely restrain our shouts when
Angel's first trout was landed with the aid of a
net, and lay golden and white as a daffodil on the
grass. So absorbed were we that no one gave
any heed to The Seraph, stationed farther down
stream, till a roar of rage discovered him, dancing
empty-handed on the bank, his rod sailing smartly
down the stream, leaving only a wake of tiny
ripples.</p>

<p>"It was a 'normous lusty trout," he wailed, "as
big as a whale, an' he swallowed my grasshopper,
an' hook, an' gave me <i>such</i> a look! And I'd
pwomised him to Mary Ellen for her tea!"</p>

<p>"We may as well give up for a while," said
the Bishop, mildly, "and have some lunch. Bring
The Seraph to me, boys, and I shall comfort him,
whilst you unpack the hamper."</p>

<p>What hearty, wholesome appetites we brought
to the cold beef and radishes! And how much
more satisfying such fare than the milky messes
served to us by Mrs. Handsomebody! Harry
had buried a bottle of ale under the cool sod, and
we had tastes of that to wash our victuals down.
Even Charles Augustus had a little of it poured
into his cell to comfort him.</p>

<p>When we were satisfied, the Bishop retired to
the shade of a hedge with his pipe; The Seraph
wandered off by himself to hunt for birds' nests;
and Angel and I took fresh flies and tried our
luck anew. But the sun was high; the south
breeze was fallen; and the trout had sought their
farthest chambers in the pool.</p>

<p>Angel soon tired when sport flagged.</p>

<p>"Let's go find the kid," he said, throwing down
the rod, "he'll be getting himself drowned if we
don't keep an eye on him. I'll race you to that
nearest apple tree!"</p>

<p>With nimble legs, and swiftly beating hearts,
we scampered over the smooth turf, and I threw
a triumphant look over my shoulder at him, as I
hurled myself upon the mossy bole of the old tree.
Then I saw that Angel had stopped stock still and
was staring open-mouthed beyond me. I turned.
Then, I, too, stared open-mouthed. Trust The
Seraph for falling on his feet! What though his
rod had been filched&mdash;here he was, without a
moment's loss, plunged in a new adventure!</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>He was seated beneath an apple tree, on the
bank of the stream in deep conversation with a
most remarkable old man, who was fishing industriously
with the very rod The Seraph so lately
had bewailed. He was an astonishingly old man,
with hair and beard as white as wool, wreathing
a face as pink as the apple-blossoms that fell about
him. Cautiously we drew near, quite unobserved
by the two who seemed utterly absorbed in their
occupation of watching the line as it dipped into
the stream. Now we could see that the old man's
clothes were ragged, and that he had taken off
his boots to ease his tired feet, the toes of which
protruded from his socks, even pinker than his
face.</p>

<p>He was speaking in a full soft voice with an accent
which was new to us.</p>

<p>"Yon trout," said he, "was in a terrible frizz
wi' the hook gnawing his vitals, and he swum
about among the reeds near the bank in a manner
to harrer your feelings. The line got tangled in
the growing stuff, and I, so quick as an otter,
pounced on him, and had him on the bank afore
'ee could say 'scat,' and there he lies breathing his
last, and blessing me no doubt for relieving him
in his shameful state."</p>

<p>"I fink he's weally my twout," said The Seraph.
"I caught him first you see."</p>

<p>"That pint might take a terr'ble understanding
lawyer to unravel," replied the old man, "but
sooner than quarrel in such an unsporting fashion,
I'll give 'ee the trout, though I had had a notion
of roasting him to my own breakfast."</p>

<p>The Seraph stroked the glistening side of the
recumbent trout admiringly; he poked his plump
forefinger into it's quivering pink gill. The result
was startling. The trout leaped into the air
with a flourish of silvery tail; then fell floundering
on The Seraph's bare knees. Our junior, seized
with one of his unaccountable impulses, grasped
him by the middle and hurled him into the stream.
A second more and the trout was gone, leaving
only a thin line of red to mark his passing. Angel
and I ran forward to protect The Seraph if need
be from the consequences of his hardy act; but the
old man was smiling placidly.</p>

<p>"That trout," he said, "is so gleeful to get away
from his captivity as I be to escape from the
work'us."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you run away from the workhouse?"
we cried, in chorus, gathering around him,
"Have you run far?" And we looked at his
broken boots.</p>

<p>"I ban't a dareful man," he replied, "that
would run down the road in daylight for the whole
nation to see, and I be terr'ble weak in the legs,
so I just crept out in the night, so quiet as a star-beam,
and sheltered in the orchard yonder, till I
seed the rod fairly put in my hand by the
Almighty, that I mid strike manna out of the
stream, like old Moses, so to speak."</p>

<p>"You're a funny man," said Angel. "You've
a rum way of talking."</p>

<p>"I come from Devon by natur," he answered,
"and my tongue still has the twist o't though I
haven't seed the moors these sixty years."</p>

<p>"You must be pretty old."</p>

<p>"Old! I be so aged that I can remember my
grandmother when she was but a rosy-cheeked
slip of a gal."</p>

<p>We stared in awe before such antiquity.</p>

<p>The Seraph ventured: "Did your grandmother
put you in the work'us?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Not she. It was my two grandsons.
Well-fixed men they be too, for Philip had a fine
cow until the bailiff took her; and Zachary thinks
naught on a Fair day o' buying meat pasties for
hisself and his missus, and parading about before
the nation wi' the gravy fair running down their
wrists. Ay&mdash;but the work'us was good enough
for old Granfa. 'Darn'ee,' says I to Philip,
'there's life in the old dog yet, and I'll escape
from here in the fulness of time!' Which I did."</p>

<p>We grouped ourselves about him in easy attitudes of attention. We felt strangely drawn to
this ancient rebel against authority. We pictured
the workhouse as a vast schoolroom where white-haired
paupers laboured over impossible tasks,
superintended by a matron, cold and angular, like
Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"Are your own children all dead?" I put the
question timidly, for I feared to recall more filial
ingratitude.</p>

<p>"Dead as door-nails," he replied, solemnly.
"All of them."</p>

<p>"Were there many?"</p>

<p>"When I had been married but seven years,
there were six; and after that I lost count. At
that time I was moved to compose a little song
about them, and I'd sing it to 'ee this moment if
I had a bite o' victuals to stay me."</p>

<p>"Look here, Seraph," I cried, "You cut back
to the hamper and fetch some beef and bread,
and anything else that's loose. Look sharp,
now."</p>

<p>The Seraph ran off obediently, and it was not
long till he re-appeared with food and the dregs
of the ale.</p>

<p>It was a treat to see Granfa make way with
these. He smacked his lips and wiped his beard
on his sleeve with the relish born of prolonged
abstinence. As he ate, the apple-blossoms fell
about him, settling on the rim of his ragged hat,
and even finding shelter among the white waves
of his beard. We sat cross-legged on the grass
before him eagerly awaiting the song.</p>

<p>At last, in a voice rich with emotion, he sang
to a strange lilting tune:</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"I be in a terr'ble fix,</p>
<p>Wife have I and childer six.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>"I'd got married just for fun,</p>
<p>When in popped Baby Number one&mdash;</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>"I'd got an easy job to do,</p>

</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>"I was fishin' in the sea,</p>

</div> <div class="stanza">

</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>"And now I'm praying hard that Heaven</p>
<p>Will keep a grip on Number Seven."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"And did Heaven keep a gwip on it?" inquired
The Seraph as soon as the last notes died
away.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," responded our friend.
"They come along so fast that I was all in a mizmaze
trying to keep track on 'em. And good
childer they was, and would never have turned
me out as their sons have had the stinkin' impidence
to do. But now, souls, tell me all about
yourselves, for I be a terr'ble perusin' man and
I like to ponder on the doings of my fellow-creatures.
Did you mention the name of a parson,
over by yon honeysuckle hedge?"</p>

<p>We thought the old man was excellent; and we
found it an easy thing to make a confidant of him.
So, while he puffed at a stubby clay pipe, we drew
closer and told him all about the Bishop and
about father and how lonely we were for him.
Blue smoke from his clay pipe spun about us, seeming
to bind us lightly in a fine web of friendship.
Through it his blue eyes shone longingly, his
pink face shone with sympathy, and his white
beard with its clinging apple-blossom petals, rose
and fell on his ragged breast.</p>

<p>"It's a great pity," said Angel, "that father
isn't here now, because I'm certain he'd be jolly
glad to adopt you for a grandfather for us. He's
a most reasonable man."</p>

<p>Our new friend shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"It would be a noble calling," he said, "but I
ban't wanted by nobody I'm afeard. I think I'll
just bide here by this pleasant stream, till in the
fulness of time I be food for worms."</p>

<p>"Could Charles Augustus have a little of you?"
asked The Seraph, sweetly.</p>

<p>"Ess Fay, he may have his share." It appeared
that the story of Charles had been told
before Angel and I had arrived.</p>

<p>"Well, you're not going to be deserted," said
Angel, in his lordly way, "we'll just adopt you on
our own. Mrs. Handsomebody won't let us have
a dog, nor a guinea pig, nor rabbits, nor even a
white rat, but, you bet, she's got to let us keep
a grandfather, if we take him right home and
say he's come for a visit, and, of course, father'll
have to pay for his board. Let's do it, eh John?"</p>

<p>When Angel's eyes sparkled with a conquering
light, few could resist him. Certainly not
I, his faithful adherent. Anyway I wanted
Granfa myself badly, so I nodded solemnly.
"Let's."</p>

<p>"It'll be the greatest lark ever," he said, "and
here comes the Bishop."</p>

<p>"Hand me my shoon, quick," said Granfa, nervously.</p>

<p>The Bishop was indeed coming slowly toward
us, across the sun-lit meadow, carrying his rod
in one hand, and in the other the tin containing
Charles Augustus. By the time he had reached
us Granfa had struggled into his boots and was
standing, hat in hand, with an air of meek expectancy. Angel, always so fluent when we were
by ourselves, balked at explaining things to grown-ups,
and, though the Bishop usually saw things
from our point of view, one could never be absolutely
certain that even he would not prove
obtuse on such a delicate issue as this.</p>

<p>So I rose, and met his enquiring look with such
explanation as suited his adult understanding.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," I said, politely, "this nice old
man has been turned out by his grandsons, and
he's on his way to town, where he's got some
kind grandsons&mdash;"</p>

<p>&mdash;"Fwee of 'em," put in The Seraph.</p>

<p>&mdash;"And we were wondering," I hurried on, "if
you'd give him a lift that far."</p>

<p>"I expect you're tired out," said the Bishop,
kindly, turning to Granfa.</p>

<p>"I be none too peart, but terrible wishful to get
under the roof o' my grandsons, thank 'ee."</p>

<p>"You shall have a seat beside Harry; I see
you've had some lunch; and now, boys, I think
we have time for an hour's fishing before we go,
but first we must dispose of Charles Augustus.
I don't like the way he looks. I don't know
whether he's just foxy and pretending he's dead
so we shan't use him for bait, or whether the ale
was too much for him. At any rate, he's looking
far from well." And the Bishop peered anxiously
into the treacle tin.</p>

<p>So the search began for the ideal mate for
Charles Augustus. He was laid in state on a
large burdock leaf, where he stretched himself
warily enough in the fervent heat of the sun.
The Seraph, quick as a robin, was the first to
pounce upon a large, but active dew-worm, which,
he announced, was Ernestine.</p>

<p>We made an excited little group around the
burdock, as The Seraph, flushed with pride, deposited
her beside the lonely Charles. She
glided toward him. She touched him. The
effect was electrical. Charles Augustus, after
one violent contortion, hurled himself from the
burdock, and, before we could intercept him, disappeared
into a bristling forest of grass blades.</p>

<p>"He's gone! He's gone!" wailed The Seraph.
"He's wun away fwom her!"</p>

<p>But, even as he spoke, the agile Ernestine
leapt lightly from the trembling leaf in hot pursuit.
Green spears bent to open a way for her;
dizzy gnats paused in their droning song, feeling
in the ether the tremor of the chase; bees fell
from the heart of honey-sweet flowers, and lay
murmuring and booming in the grass.</p>

<p>They were gone. An ant had mounted the
burdock leaf, and, careless of the drama that had
just been enacted, sought eagerly among the
crevices for provender. The Bishop spoke first.</p>

<p>"I think she'll get him," he said musingly.
"She's got a sort of cave-woman look, and she
has no petticoats to impede her."</p>

<p>"Ess fay," assented Granfa, "her'll get him,
and hold him fast too, I'll be bound. A terr'ble
powerful worm."</p>

<p>We stood in silence for a space, our eyes fixed
on the ground picturing that chase through dim
subterranean passages, smelling of spring showers;
Charles Augustus, wasted, febrile, panting
with agitation; Ernestine, lithe, ardent, awful in
her purpose.</p>

<p>We were still pensive when we retraced our
steps across the meadow. The Bishop and
Harry and The Seraph resumed their fishing,
but Angel and I preferred to be on the grass beside
Granfa, while he told us tales of old smuggling
days in Devon and Cornwall, where his little cutter
had slipped round about the delicate yet rugged
coast, loaded with brandy and bales of silk
from France, guided by strange red and blue
lights from the shore; and where solemn cormorants
kept darkly secret all they saw when they
sailed aloft at dawn.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>We were delighted with Granfa. It seemed
to us that the acquiring of him was the finest
thing we had yet done. This elation of
spirit remained with us during all the drive home.
The grey old town was wrapped in a golden mist
of romance; its windows reflected the fire of the
sunset. It was not until we had separated from
the Bishop and stood, a group of four, before
Mrs. Handsomebody's house, that dread misgiving
took the pith out of our legs. All of a sudden
Granfa loomed bulky and solid; the problem of
where he was to be stowed presented itself. He
was not like Giftie to be hidden in the scullery.
He was not even like a white rat that could
be secreted under one's bed till its unfortunate
odour resulted in painful research. No; Granfa
must be accounted for, and that soon.</p>

<p>"Better go round to the back," suggested
Angel, "and tackle Mary Ellen first."</p>

<p>So we traversed the chill passage between the
tall houses, and softly lifted the latch of the
kitchen door. Mary Ellen was alone, her work
done, her nose buried in a novel of such fine print
that it necessitated the lamp's being perilously
near the fringe of frowsy hair that covered her
forehead. We were inside the kitchen before she
was recalled from the high life in which she
revelled.</p>

<p>"Is it yersilves?" she exclaimed, with a start.
"Sure, you've give me a nice fright prowlin' about
like thaves&mdash;and whoiver may be the ould man
wid ye? The mistress'll stand no tramps or
beggars about, as well you know."</p>

<p>"He's no tramp or beggar," I retorted, stoutly,
"he's Granfa."</p>

<p>"Granfa! Granfa who? Noan o' your nonsense,
now, byes. What's the truth now, spit it
out!"</p>

<p>"He's Granfa," I reiterated, desperately, "Our
own nice grandfather that we haven't seen for
years, and&mdash;he's just come for a nice little visit
with us. Why, Mary Ellen, the Bishop knows
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Known him for years," put in Angel. "Went
to Harrow together."</p>

<p>"Ess fay," assented Granfa, eagerly. "Us
were boon companions up to Harrer."</p>

<p>"The Bishop brought him wight here in the
pony twap," added The Seraph, "and we'd all yike
a little nushment, please."</p>

<p>Mary Ellen, in spite of herself, was half convinced.
Granfa's blue eyes were so candid; there
was an air of dignity about his snow-white locks
and beard, that disarmed hostility.</p>

<p>"Look here, now," said Mary Ellen, in an
aside, to us, "he seems a nice ould gentlemin
enough, but think av the throuble ye got us in over
Giftie, sure I won't have yez experimentalling wid
grandfathers."</p>

<p>Granfa appeared to have overheard, for he
spoke up.</p>

<p>"I just want to bide here a little while, my
dearie, till I hear from my son in South Americer.
The other two put me out, you see, so I've only
him to depend on, till I be called away."</p>

<p>Mary Ellen flushed. "You'd be welcome to
stay if it was my house, sir; but my misthress is
to be reckoned wid. By God's mercy, she is off
to a missionary meeting tonight, her bein' president
av the society for makin' Unitarians out av
the blacks. Sorra a thing will she hear of this
till mornin', and I'll put you in my own bed, and
slape on two cheers in the scullery, for it'd niver
do for the boys' grandfather to be used like a
beggar-man."</p>

<p>We thought it a capital idea for Mary Ellen to
sleep in the scullery&mdash;it would save her the fag of
running downstairs in the morning to get breakfast,
and Granfa would be conveniently placed for
us, in case we wanted a story or game before
breakfast.</p>

<p>So, after partaking of a little nourishment, as
The Seraph put it, we retired to Mary Ellen's
room; she leading the way up the dark backstairs
with a lighted candle; Granfa next bearing his
little bundle; and we three in the rear, exceedingly
tired, but in excellent spirits.</p>

<p>Granfa looked very snug in Mary Ellen's bed,
with his curly beard resting comfortably on the
red and white quilt, and his blue eyes twinkling
up at us.</p>

<p>"Comfy, Granfa?" asked The Seraph.</p>

<p>"I be just so cozy as an old toad," he replied.
"I do believe I'm a-going to be terr'ble happy in
my new home."</p>

<p>Mary Ellen had gone downstairs to prepare her
place in the scullery, so we climbed on the bed
with him, making believe it was a smuggler's cutter,
and had many hair-raising adventures that
were brought to an end, at last, by the discovery
that Granfa was fast asleep.</p>

<p>We were at the windlass heaving up the anchor,
at the time, and had just struck up a sailor's
chanty, which made a good deal of noise, but
nothing seemed to disturb Granfa. He slumbered
peacefuly through all the rattle of chains,
and shouting of commands, so, somewhat subdued,
we decided there was nothing for it but to seek
our berths.</p>

<p>Snug beneath our covers, at last, we felt to the
full, the new spirit of adventure that had spread
its irridescent wings over the house. There was
Granfa, snoring under Mary Ellen's patchwork
quilt; there was the trusty Mary Ellen, herself,
stowed away in the scullery; there was Mrs.
Handsomebody, on missionary duty among the
blacks; here were we&mdash;The Seraph expressed our
feelings exactly just before we fell asleep.
"We'm terr'ble lucky chaps," he said, in the
Devon dialect, "ban't us?"</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Our bedroom window was always tightly
closed, and, at night, so were the shutters; yet
a sunbeam, adventurous, like ourselves, found its
way through a broken slat, and, cleaving the
heavy air of the chamber, flew straight to The
Seraph's nose, where it perched, lending a radiant
prominence to that soft feature.</p>

<p>The Seraph roused himself. He opened his
eyes; the sunbeam found them two dark forest
pools, and plunged therein. The Seraph opened
his mouth and laughed, showing all his little white
teeth, and the sunbeam dived straightway down
his throat.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" cried The Seraph, "let's get up!"
And scrambled out of bed.</p>

<p>At the same instant came a loud tapping on the
door of Mary Ellen's bedroom. We surmised,
correctly, that Mrs. Handsomebody, listening in
vain for the sound of her handmaiden's descent
of the back stairs had risen wrathfully, and
come to summon her in person. A chill of apprehension
ran along my spine. I got up and
stole to the door, followed by my brothers.
Through a crack we peered fearfully in the
direction of the rapping, our trembling bodies
close together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody, in purple dressing-gown
and red woollen slippers, stood in a listening
attitude, her gaze bent on the door that hid
Granfa.</p>

<p>"Are you aware of the hour?" she demanded
peremptorily. "Rise at once and open this
door."</p>

<p>There was a creaking of the mattress and
sound of shuffling feet; the door was opened reluctantly,
and Granfa, bare-legged, white of
beard and red-shirted, stood in the aperture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody did not shriek; rather
she made the inarticulate noises of one in a nightmare
and put out her hands as if to keep Granfa
off. "Merciful Heaven!" she whispered.
"What has happened to you?"</p>

<p>"I do feel far from peart," replied Granfa.</p>

<p>"This is horrible. Did you feel it coming on?"</p>

<p>"Off and on for a long time," said Granfa.
"It's been a terr'ble experience, and I ban't likely
to be ever the same again, I'm afeared."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody looked ready to faint.</p>

<p>At that moment, Mary Ellen, having heard
the voice of her mistress, projected her face
above the doorsill of the backstairs. It was always
a rosy face, but now with excitement and
shamefacedness, it was as red as a harvest moon,
coming up from the darkness.</p>

<p>The sight of her turned Mrs. Handsomebody's
terror into rage.</p>

<p>"Shameful, depraved girl," she gobbled, "who
is this you have in your chamber? Ah, I've
caught you! The ingratitude! You terrible
old wretch!"&mdash;this to Granfa&mdash;"close that door
instantly while I send for the police!"</p>

<p>By this time we had ventured into the hall,
and, Mrs. Handsomebody, seeing us groaned:
"Under the roof with these innocent children&mdash;I
thought that in my care their innocence was
safe."</p>

<p>"It was thim same innocents that brung him
here," said Mary Ellen, stung into disclosing our
part in the scandal, "and it's himsilf is their own
grandfather."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody's gaze was appalling as
she turned it on us three.</p>

<p>"You? Your grandfather? What fresh insanity
is this?"</p>

<p>"You see," I explained, keeping my fascinated
eyes on the wart on her chin, "he's just
come for a little visit, and he really is our Granfa,
and we love him awfully."</p>

<p>"Won't have him abused," spluttered The
Seraph.</p>

<p>"Be rights," added Mary Ellen, solemnly, "he
should have the best spare room, the byes' own
aged relation."</p>

<p>"I shall sift this affair," said Mrs. Handsomebody,
"to its most appalling dregs. You, Alexander"&mdash;to The Seraph&mdash;"are the smallest, look
through that keyhole and inform me what he is
doing."</p>

<p>The Seraph obeyed, chuckling. "He's took to
the bed again&mdash;all exceptin' one leg&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can dispense with detail," cut in our
governess. "Is he at all violent?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, no," replied Mary Ellen. "He's
as mild mannered as can be and an old friend
of the Bishop's, so they say. 'Twas him that
brung him home in his pony trap."</p>

<p>"The Bishop! I must see the Bishop instantly."</p>

<p>As she spoke a stentorian shout of "Butcher!"
came from the regions below.</p>

<p>"There," she said, to Mary Ellen, "is young
Watlin. Call him up instantly; and he shall
guard the door while I dress. Explain the situation
very briefly to him. It would be well to
arm him with a poker, in case the old man becomes
violent. David, go to Bishop Torrance
and tell him that I hope he will call on me at
once, if possible. Put on your clothes, but you
may leave your hair in disorder, just as it is. It
will serve to show the Bishop into what a state of
panic this household has been thrown."</p>

<p>She was obliged to retire hastily to her room
because of the arrival of Mr. Watlin.</p>

<p>It was some time before Mary Ellen, and The
Seraph, and I could make him understand what
had happened, though we all tried at once.</p>

<p>"And you mean to tell me that he's in there?"
he asked, at last, grinning broadly.</p>

<p>"Sorra a place else," replied Mary Ellen, "and
you're to guard the door till the police comes."</p>

<p>"Guard nothink," said Mr. Watlin, belligerently,
"I'll go right in and tackle him single-handed."</p>

<p>With one accord The Seraph and I flung ourselves
before the door.</p>

<p>"You shan't hurt him," we cried, "he's our
own Granfa! We'll fight you first."</p>

<p>Mr. Watlin made some playful passes at our
stomachs. "Let's all have a fight," he chaffed.
Then he said&mdash;"Hullo, here's the old 'un himself,
and quite a character to be sure. No wonder
Mrs. 'Andsomebody is in a taking."</p>

<p>The door had opened behind us; Granfa stood
revealed, wearing his ragged coat and hat, and
carrying his stick and little bundle, wrapped in a
red handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Don't 'ee get in a frizz, my dears, about me,"
he said with dignity. "I be leaving this instant
moment. As for you&mdash;" addressing Mr. Watlin&mdash;"you
be a gert beefy critter, but don't be
too sure you could tackle me, single-handed. I
be terr'ble full of power when I'm roused, and
it takes a deal to calm me down again." And
he trotted to the head of the stairs and began to
descend.</p>

<p>The Seraph and I kept close on either side of
him, tightly holding his hands.</p>

<p>"She's in the parlour," I whispered, "and the
Bishop's with her. Shall you go in?"</p>

<p>Granfa nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>We stood in the doorway of the sacred apartment.
Even there, the spirit of the May morning
seemed to have penetrated, for in the glass
case a stuffed oriole had cocked his eye with a
longing look at a withered nest that hung before
him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody had just finished her recital.
"I thought I should have swooned," she
said.</p>

<p>"And no wonder," replied the Bishop, "I'm
quite sure I should have." Then he turned to us
with a look of mingled amusement and concern.
"Now what do you suppose I'm going to do with
you Granfa?"</p>

<p>"Oh, parson, don't 'ee send me back to the
work'us! If I bide there any longer, 'twill break
my fine spirit."</p>

<p>"I am going to propose something very different,"
said the Bishop, kindly. "We need another
sweeper and duster about the Cathedral,
and if you think you are strong enough to wield
a broom, you may earn a decent living. I know
a very kind charwoman, who would lodge and
board you, and you would be near your little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gwandsons," said The Seraph.</p>

<p>"Silence!" ordered Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"You would be near us all," finished the Bishop,
blandly.</p>

<p>"Ess fay. I can wield a broom," said Granfa.
"And 'twill be a noble end for me to pass my
days in such a holy spot. 'Twill be but a short
jump from there fair into Heaven itself, and I
do thank 'ee, parson, with all my heart."</p>

<p>So it was settled, and turned out excellently.
Even Mary Ellen could have learned from Granfa
new ways of handling a broom with the least exertion
to the worker; aye, in his hands, the broom
seemed used chiefly as a support; a staff, upon
which he leant while telling us many a tale of
those rare old smuggling days of his youth.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in dim unused parts of the building,
we would rig up a pirate's ship, and Granfa
would fix the broom to the masthead to show
that he, like Drake, had swept the seas.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, we found him fast asleep
in a corner of some crimson-cushioned pew, looking
so peaceful that, rough sea-going fellows
though we were, we had not the heart to rouse
him.</p>

<p>Once, standing before the stained glass window
in memory of young Cosmo John, Granfa said:</p>

<p>"It beats all how thiccy lad does yearn toward
me. His eyes follow me wherever I go."</p>

<p>"And no wonder, Granfa," cried The Seraph,
throwing his arms around him, "for everybody
loves 'ee so!"</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch8">Chapter VIII: Noblesse
Oblige</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Angel and I grew amazingly that summer.
We grew in length of limb but with no corresponding
gain in scholastic stature. We had
made up our minds to retain as little as possible
of Mrs. Handsomebody's teaching and we had
succeeded so well in our purpose, that, at nine
and ten we had about as much book-learning as
would have befitted The Seraph, while he retained
the serene ignorance of babyhood. But
in affairs of the imagination we were no laggards.
We eagerly drank in Granfa's tales of the sea,
and Harry lent us many a hair-raising book of
adventure.</p>

<p>Yet we longed for the companionship of other
boys of our own age, and strained towards the
day when we should go to school. Our abounding
energy chafed more and more under the rule
of Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>Now she had left the schoolroom to interview
a plumber, and her black bombazine dress
having sailed away like a cloud, we had utterly
relaxed, and were basking in the sunshine of her
absence.</p>

<p>Slumped on my spine, I was watching a spider,
just over my head, that was leisurely ascending
his shining rope-ladder to the ceiling. I contemplated
his powers of retreat with an almost
bitter envy. Fancy being able, at a moment's
notice, to bolt out of reach (even out of sight
and hearing) of all that was obnoxious to a
fellow! I pictured myself, when some particularly
harassing question had been put by my
governess, springing from my seat, snatching the
ever-ready shining rope and making for some
friendly cornice, where, with my six or eight legs
wrapped round my head, I would settle down for
a snug sleep, not to be disturbed by any female.</p>

<p>Yet, I had to admit, that if any one in the
schoolroom played the r&ocirc;le of spider, it was
Mrs. Handsomebody herself, whose desk was the
centre of a web of books, pencils, rulers and a
cane, in the meshes of which we three were caught
like young flies, before our bright wings had been
unfolded.</p>

<p>I looked at The Seraph. After slavishly making
pot hooks all the afternoon, he was now licking
them off his slate with unaffected relish. I
turned to Angel.</p>

<p>With hands thrust deep in his pockets he was
staring disconsolately at the unfinished sum before
him. I, too, had given it up in despair.</p>

<p>"It's mediocre," he muttered. "Absolutely
mediocre, and I won't stand it."</p>

<p><i>Mediocre.</i> It was a new word to me, and I
wondered where he had picked it up. It was
like Angel to spring it on me this way.</p>

<p>"Awfully mediocre," I assented. "And it
can't be done."</p>

<p>A flicker of annoyance crossed his face that
his new word should be thus lightly bandied, but
he went on&mdash;"Just listen here: an apple-woman
who had four score of apples in her cart, sold
three dozen at four pence, half-penny a dozen;
two and a half dozen at five pence a dozen. At
what price would she have to sell the remaining,
in order to realize"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And look here," I interrupted, wrathfully,
"Why does she always give us sums about an
apple-woman, or a muffin-man? It just makes
a chap hungry. Why doesn't she make one up
about a dentist for a change, or somethin' like
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Angel, catching at the idea.
"Like this: if a dentist pulled five teeth out of one
lady, and seven and a half out of another, at
two shillings apiece how many must he pull in
order to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then there's undertakers," I broke in. "If
a undertaker buried nine corpses one day, and
six and a half the next&mdash;"</p>

<p>I had to stop, for Angel was convulsed with
laughter, and The Seraph was beginning to get
noisy.</p>

<p>Angel produced a small bottle of licorice water
from his pocket and took a long mouthful. Then
he handed it to me. It was soothing, delicious.</p>

<p>"Me too!" cried The Seraph, and I held it to
his eager little mouth.</p>

<p>"Here," said Angel angrily, "he's swiggin'
down the whole thing. Drop it, young'un!"</p>

<p>At the same moment, the door opened quietly,
and Mrs. Handsomebody entered. I tore the bottle
from The Seraph's clinging lips, and stuffed
it, corkless, into my pocket.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody sat down and disposed
her skirt about her knees. Her eyes travelled
over us.</p>

<p>"Alexander," she said to The Seraph, "stand
up." He meekly rose.</p>

<p>"What is that on your chin?"</p>

<p>The Seraph explored his chin with his tongue.</p>

<p>"It tastes sweet," he said.</p>

<p>"I asked what is it?"</p>

<p>The Seraph shot an imploring glance at Angel.</p>

<p>"I fink," he hedged, "it's some of the gwavy
fwom dinner left over."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody turned to Angel and me.</p>

<p>"Stand up," she commanded, sternly, "and we
shall sift this matter to the root."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Angel, nonchalantly. "It
was licorice root made into a drink."</p>

<p>"Licorice root," repeated our governess, in a
tone of disgust. "It is by imbibing such vile
concoctions that the taste for more ardent spirits
is created. When I was your age, I had taken
no beverage save milk and hot water, from which
I graduated naturally to weak tea, and from
thence to the&mdash;er&mdash;stronger brew. I am at present
your guardian as well as your teacher and I
shall do my utmost to eradicate&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was impossible to follow her discourse because
of the keen discomfort I was feeling as the
remainder of the licorice water trickled down my
right leg. I was brought up with a start by Mrs.
Handsomebody almost shouting:</p>

<p>"John! What is that puddle on the floor beneath
you? Don't move! Stay where you
are." She sprang to my side and grasped my
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I s'pose it's some more of the woot," giggled
The Seraph.</p>

<p>I put my hand in my pocket and produced the
empty bottle. Mrs. Handsomebody took it between
her thumb and forefinger. She gave me
a sharp rap on the head with it.</p>

<p>"Now," she gobbled, "go to your room and
remain there till the exercises are over, then return
to me for punishment. <i>And</i> change your
trousers."</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>My trousers had been changed. Afternoon
school was over, and I had just finished the last
weary line in the long imposition set by Mrs.
Handsomebody. I stretched my cramped limbs,
and wondered dully where my brothers were.
My depression was increased by the fact that the
freshly-donned trousers were brown tweed, while
my jacket was of blue serge.</p>

<p>I laid the imposition on Mrs. Handsomebody's
desk, and listlessly set out to find the others. I
could hear Mary Ellen in the kitchen thumping
a mop against the legs of the furniture in a savage
manner that bespoke no mood of airy persiflage.
Therefore, I did not go down the back stairs,
but throwing a leg over the hand-rail of the
front stairs, I slowly slid to the bottom, and
rested there a space on my stomach, an attitude
peaceful, and conducive to clear thinking.</p>

<p>I reviewed the situation dispassionately. Here
was I, who had scarcely been at all to blame,
humiliated, an outcast, so to speak, while Angel,
who had made the beastly mess, went unscathed.
As for The Seraph! I could scarcely bear to
think of him with his tell-tale sticky little chin.</p>

<p>Voices roused me. Buoyant with animation,
they penetrated beyond the closed front door. A
loud unknown voice, mingled with those of Angel
and The Seraph.</p>

<p>In an instant, I was on my feet, my nose pressed
against one of the narrow windows of ruby-coloured
glass that were on either side of the hall
door. I could see three small red figures in animated
conversation on the square grass plot
before the house. The largest of the three began
to execute a masterly hop, skip and jump on
the crimson grass. Above arched the sanguine
sky.</p>

<p>I opened the door and closing it softly behind
me, stood on the steps.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a sturdy fellow about a year
older than Angel. He had a devil-may-care air
about him, and he wore, at a rakish angle, a cap,
bearing the badge of a well-known school. He
turned to me instantly.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you're a rum-lookin' pup."</p>

<p>I was rather abashed at such a greeting, but
I held my ground. "My name is John," I replied
simply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he groaned. "<i>John!</i> Don't
you know enough to give your surname? Eh?
I wish we had you at my school for a term.
We'd lick you into shape."</p>

<p>"His surname is Curzon, too," put in Angel,
"same as mine."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the boy, "you're Curzon
major, Curzon minor, and Curzon minimus.
Hear that, Curzon minimus?" he shouted, tweaking
The Seraph's ear.</p>

<p>"I say," said Angel, "you let him alone!"
And I ran down the steps. The boy stared.</p>

<p>"Don't you keep him in order?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Rather," replied Angel, "but I don't hurt him
for nothing."</p>

<p>"I have two young brothers," said the boy,
"and I hurt them for next to nothing. Licks
'em into shape."</p>

<p>He looked around him and then added,
"There's no fun here. Let's hook it to my place,
and I'll show you my rabbits. I've taken a
fancy to you, and, if you like, I'll let you call me
by my first name. It's Simon. And I'll call you
by yours. That minor and minimus business is
rather rotten when you're friends. Come along."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody, we knew, was safe at a
lecture on The Application of Science to Human
Relationships; Mary Ellen was doing her Friday's
cleaning; therefore, we set off with our
new-found friend without fear of hindrance from
the female section of our household.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>As we trotted along, Simon told us that his
family had taken a large old house that had stood
vacant ever since we had come to live with Mrs.
Handsomebody. How often we had timidly
passed its dingy front, wondering what might be
within its closed shutters and deep-set front door!</p>

<p>Now, as we approached, we saw that the sign,
To Let, had been taken down; the door and shutters
were wide open; and, one of the shutters,
hanging at a rakish angle, much as Simon wore
his cap, gave a promise of jollity and lack of
restraint within.</p>

<p>"We shall just cut around to the back garden,"
announced Simon. "The kids are there, and
need putting in order by the row they are making."</p>

<p>We passed through a low door in the wall that
separated the front garden from the back. The
wall was overgrown with dusty untrimmed
creepers, from which a flock of sparrows flew
when the door was opened.</p>

<p>For a moment, we could scarcely take in the
scene before us; in our experience it was so unprecedented.
But Simon did not seem in the
least surprised.</p>

<p>"Hi, kids!" he yelled, "just keep that water
off us, will you! Put down that hose, Mops!"</p>

<p>Mops was a girl a little younger than Simon.
She stood in the middle of the garden, a hose in
her hands, and she was absorbed in drenching two
half-naked small boys and five fox terriers, who
circled around her like performers in a circus
ring. The noise of yelling boys and barking dogs
was terrific.</p>

<p>"What's she doing?" we gasped.</p>

<p>"It's so dev'lish hot that the hose feels bully.
Like to try it?"</p>

<p>"I wish we had got our bathing suits," said
Angel.</p>

<p>"Never mind. I think there's a couple of
pairs of trunks in the scullery, and the young
'un can have a pinafore of Mopsie's."</p>

<p>He led the way down some littered steps into a
basement room, where a dishevelled maid was
blacking boots.</p>

<p>"Here Playter," he ordered, "dig up some togs
for a hosing, will you? And be sharp about it,
there's a love."</p>

<p>The girl obligingly dropped her boots, and
turning out the contents of a cupboard, produced
some faded blue bathing trunks.</p>

<p>To us they seemed shamelessly inadequate, but
Simon appeared satisfied. Now he hurried us to
a summer-house occupied by a family of lop-eared
rabbits, and here we changed into the trunks.
The Seraph required some help, and when he was
stripped, I could see his little heart pounding
away at his ribs, for, between the exertion of
keeping up to us, and not quite understanding why
he was being undressed, he was very much
wrought up.</p>

<p>"It's just fun," I reassured him. "Don't get
funky."</p>

<p>"I'm not," he whispered, as I tied on his trunks,
"but I fink it's a dangerous enterpwise."</p>

<p>"Time's up," yelled Simon, "get into the
game!"</p>

<p>We leaped from the summer-house to the
grass, and, refreshing it was to our bare soles.
The first onslaught from the hose almost knocked
my legs from under me, and, indeed, throughout
the game, Mops seemed to single me out for
special attention. We three had never in our
lives given way to such an abandon of wildness.
The Seraph yelled till he was hoarse, and, when
at last Mops surrendered the hose to Simon, the
orgy grew wilder still.</p>

<p>In the midst of it, a French window at the back
of the house opened, and a lady stood on the
threshold.</p>

<p>My senses had received only a delicate impression
of pink satin, golden hair, and flashing rings,
when Simon turned the hose, in full force, on the
step just below her, sending a shower of drops all
about her. With a scream she fled indoors,
slamming the French window.</p>

<p>"You got her that time, all right," said Mops,
grinning roguishly.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Oh, just mummy," replied Simon, nonchalantly.</p>

<p>The French window opened again. This time
a young man in grey tweeds appeared. I quite
expected to see him greeted with a shower also,
but Simon respectfully lowered the hose.</p>

<p>"Did you turn that hose on your mother,
Simon?" asked the young man sternly.</p>

<p>"Just a little," answered Simon.</p>

<p>"Well, the next time you do it you'll get your
jacket dusted, do you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>The young man disappeared into the house,
three of the wet dogs following him.</p>

<p>"Isn't Lord Simon sweet?" asked Mops, with
another roguish smile at me.</p>

<p>"Awfully," I replied politely, "but is the lady
really your mother?"</p>

<p>"Let's feed," interrupted Simon, throwing
down the hose, "I've a rare old twist on."</p>

<p>I was sorry he had interrupted us, for I yearned
towards Mops, and I felt that further conversation
with me would be acceptable to her, but we
were swept away in the stampede for food to the
basement kitchens.</p>

<p>They seemed immense to me, and full of the
jolliest servants I had ever seen. Two men-servants
in livery were playing a game of cribbage
at one end of a long littered table, while several
laughing maid-servants hung over their shoulders.
The game was suspended at our entrance, and
they all turned to ask us questions and chaff us
about our appearance. One of the fox terriers
jumped on the table and began nosing among the
saucepans. Nobody stopped him. The fat,
good-natured cook busied herself in spreading
bread and butter with Sultana raisins for us; the
maid-servants made a great fuss over The Seraph.</p>

<p>In such a whirlwind did this family live that
just as I was beginning to feel at ease in this extraordinary
kitchen, I was rushed back to the garden
to play, a somewhat solid feeling in my
stomach telling me that the bread and Sultanas
had arrived.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for stilts," screamed Mops.</p>

<p>"Just the thing," assented Simon. "Here
young Bunny and Bill, fetch the stilts, and be
sharp about it&mdash;hear?" and he gave them each a
punch in the ribs.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Bunny and Bill scampered
across the grass, the fox-terriers yelping at their
heels, and, from a convenient out-house all sizes
of stilts were produced.</p>

<p>These accomplished children could do all manner
of amazing feats on the stilts; even little Bill
laughed at our awkward attempts. But, after
many falls, Angel and I could limp haltingly
about the garden, and experienced the new joy of
looking down at things instead of up.</p>

<p>We noticed presently that Simon was propped
against the high wall that divided this garden
from the next. In a moment he called to us:</p>

<p>"Toddle over here and see what the old girls
are doing."</p>

<p>"Who does he mean?" I asked Mops, as we
moved stiffly, side by side.</p>

<p>"It's the Unaquarium parson's garden," she
said. "I expect they're having a tea-fight.
They're always up to something fishy."</p>

<p>Something ominous in the words should have
warned me, but I was too elated to be heedful of
signs or portents. I clutched the wall, and, with
a grin of amusement, gazed down at the group of
ladies, who, with two gentlemen in black, were
drinking tea on the lawn.</p>

<p>Bunny threw a green pear at the thin legs of the
taller gentleman.</p>

<p>The gentleman shied in a most spirited fashion,
slopping his tea.</p>

<p>Everybody turned to look in our direction.</p>

<p>"Duck," hissed Mops.</p>

<p>But it was too late to duck. Several ladies
were already sweeping towards us.</p>

<p>Then my soul fainted within me, for the voice
of the being who ruled our little universe spoke
as from a dark cloud.</p>

<p>"David! John! Alexander!" gobbled the Voice,
"are you gone mad? Come here instantly&mdash;but
no&mdash;you appear to be nude&mdash;answer me&mdash;are you
nude?"</p>

<p>Mops answered for us; we were too afflicted
for speech.</p>

<p>"If you mean naket, we're not," she said, "but
the dressed-up part of us is on this side."</p>

<p>I was conscious of murmuring voices: What
a terrible little girl; indeed the whole family; as
for the mother&mdash;Yes&mdash;my pupils, and, for the
present, my wards&mdash;Once they even threw a
dead rat over!</p>

<p>Then up spoke Mrs. Handsomebody. "Put
on your clothes," she ordered, "and meet me at
the corner. I shall be waiting."</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>We had put on our clothes. We had met her
but, good Heaven! what a Rendezvous! She,
and Angel, and I were pallid with suppressed emotions,
while The Seraph's face was flushed crimson.
He was weeping loudly, as he followed in
our wake, and walking with some difficulty, since
Angel and I, in our agitation, had put his trousers
on back to front.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody placed us in a row, on
three chairs in the dining-room, and seated herself
opposite to us. After removing her bonnet,
and giving it to Mary Ellen to carry upstairs to
the wardrobe, she said:</p>

<p>"If I believed that you realized the enormity
of what you have done, I should write to South
America to your father, and tell him that I would
no longer undertake the responsibility of three
boys so evilly inclined. What do you suppose my
sensations were when, at the close of the lecture,
the other ladies, the professor, our pastor, and
myself adjourned to the garden for tea, to find
you three perched, almost nude, on a wall, in such
company?"</p>

<p>"Do you know that those people are not respectable?
The man, I am told, is a rake, who attends
cockfights, and the mother of those children
has been seen in the garden&mdash;<i>tight</i>!"</p>

<p>"Was that the lady in pink satin?" asked
Angel, showing interest for the first time.</p>

<p>"I daresay. One would expect to find her in
pink satin."</p>

<p>The lecture went on, but I did not hear it; my
mind dwelt insistently on thoughts of the lady in
pink.</p>

<p>"What did she do, please?" I interrupted,
thoughtlessly, at last.</p>

<p>"Who do?"</p>

<p>"The lady. When she was tight."</p>

<p>"So that is where your thoughts were," said
Mrs. Handsomebody, angrily, "nice speculations
indeed, for a little boy!"</p>

<p>"I should yike a little nushment, please," interrupted
The Seraph in his turn.</p>

<p>"Not nourishment, but punishment is what you
will get, young man," replied our governess,
tartly. "What you three need is discipline at
the hands of a strong man. We shall now go
upstairs."</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>It was over. The gas was out, and we were
in bed. Not snugly in bed, but smartingly; each
trying to find a cool place on the sheets, and
things very much bedewed by the tears of The
Seraph.</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Angel, rather huskily. "It
was worth it, I'd do it again like a shot."</p>

<p>"So would I," I assented. "Whatever do you
s'pose they're up to now!"</p>

<p>And, indeed, the thought of this spirited
family coloured all my dreams. As in dancing
rainbows they whirled about my bed: Mops with
the hose; Bunny and Bill twinkling on stilts;
Simon with all the dogs at his heels; and above
all, the lady in pink, presiding like a golden-haired goddess, and very "tight."</p>

<p>We were still in black disgrace at breakfast.
Scarcely dared we raise our eyes to the cold face
of Mrs. Handsomebody, lest she should read in
them some yearning recollection of yesterday's
misdeeds. Large spoonfuls of porridge and thin
milk made unwonted gurgling noises as they hurried
down our throats to our empty young
stomachs.</p>

<p>When we had done, and The Seraph had offered
thanks to God for this good meal, Mrs.
Handsomebody marched us, like conscripts to
the schoolroom, where she assigned to each of us
a task to keep him busy until her return from
market.</p>

<p>But the front door had barely closed upon her
black bombazine dress, when we scampered to the
head of the stairs, threw ourselves upon the
hand-rail, and slid lightly to the bottom, and
from there ran to find Mary Ellen in the parlour.</p>

<p>She was sweeping out the sombre room
with such listless movements of her plump, red
arms, that the moist tea-leaves on the floor
scarce moved beneath the broom.</p>

<p>"Sure, I niver see sich a cairpet as this in all
me born days," she was saying. "If I was to
swape till I fell prostitute, I'd niver git it clane."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother about the work, Mary
Ellen!" we cried. "Just listen to the adventure
we had yesterday!"</p>

<p>"I listened to the hindermost part of it," she
returned, "and it sounded purty lively."</p>

<p>"Who cares?" said Angel. "It didn't hurt a
bit."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," assented The Seraph, cheerily.
"She gets weaker evwy day, and I get stwonger."</p>

<p>We rushed upon Mary Ellen then with the
whole story of our new friends, dwelling,
especially, upon our visit below stairs, and the
rollicking men and maid-servants we found there.</p>

<p>"They were drinking beer-and-gin," concluded
Angel, "and the scullery-maid did a breakdown
for us in a pair of hunting boots."</p>

<p>"It beats all," said Mary Ellen, leaning on her
broom, "what kapes me in a dull place like this,
whin there do be sich wild goin's on just around
the corner like. I'd give a month's wage to see
thim folks."</p>

<p>"Come around with me," suggested Angel,
"and I'll introduce you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Masther Angel. Misther Watlin,
me young man, wouldn't want me to be goin' into
mixed company widout him. An it do seem a
pity, too, since I have me new blue dress, for
if ever I look lovely, I look lovely in blue." And
she attacked the tea-leaves with a lagging broom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody, when dinner was over,
fixed us with her cold grey eye, and said:</p>

<p>"Since you have proved yourselves utterly untrustworthy,
you shall be locked in your bedroom,
during my absence this afternoon. Mary
Ellen, who will be engaged in cleaning the coal
cellar, has been instructed to supply you with
bread and milk at four o'clock. By exemplary
behaviour today, you will ensure a return to your
customary privileges tomorrow."</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>The prison door was locked. The gaoler
gone.</p>

<p>Thus our Saturday half-holiday!</p>

<p>Angel and I threw ourselves, face downward,
on the bed. Not so The Seraph. Folding his
arms, which were almost too short to fold, he
stood before the single window, gazing through
its grimy glass at the brick wall opposite, as
though determined to find something cheerful in
the outlook.</p>

<p>Aeons passed.</p>

<p>Familiar faces began to leer at me from the
pattern in the wall-paper. Angel was despondently
counting out his money on the counter-pane,
and trying to make three half-pennys and
a penny with a hole through it, look like affluence.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a rattling of hard particles on the pane. As we stared at each other
in surprise, another volley followed. It was a
signal, and no mistake! Already The Seraph
was tapping the window in response. A moment
of violent exertion passed before we could get it
open. Then, thrusting out our heads we discovered
Simon standing in the passage below,
his upturned face wearing an anxious grin.</p>

<p>"Thought I'd never get you," he whispered
hoarsely. "I saw the Dragon go out, so I fired
a handful of gravel at every window in turn.
Come on out."</p>

<p>"We can't. We're locked in!" we chorused
dismally.</p>

<p>"I'll try to catch you if you jump," he suggested.
"I would break the fall, anyway."</p>

<p>But the way looked long, and Simon very small.</p>

<p>Then: "There's a ladder," cried The Seraph,
gleefully, "better twy that."</p>

<p>With his usual clear-sightedness, he had spied
what had escaped his seniors. Our neighbour,
Mr. Mortimer Pegg, had been having some
paper hung, and, surely enough, the workmen
had left a tall ladder propped against the wall of
the house. Without a second's hesitation, Simon
flung himself upon it, and with one splendid
effort, hurled it from that support to the wall of
Mrs. Handsomebody's house. Then, with the
strength of a superman, he dragged it until it
leaned just below our window, and stood gasping
at its base.</p>

<p>"Good fellow," said Angel, and began to climb
out.</p>

<p>"Now, you hand me The Seraph," he ordered,
"and I'll attend to him."</p>

<p>I had some misgivings as I passed his plump,
clinging little person through the window, and
watched him make the perilous descent, but, in
time, he reached the ground, and then I, too,
stood beside the others, and the four of us
scampered lightly down the street with no misgivings,
and no fears.</p>

<p>Before the door of our own grocer, Simon
made a halt.</p>

<p>"Must have somethin' wet," he gasped.
"Ladder nearly floored me."</p>

<p>He took us in and treated us with princely unconcern
to ginger beer and a jam puff apiece.
As we sucked our beer through straws, I smiled
to think of Mary Ellen, doubtless preparing
bread and milk at home.</p>

<p>Once more we entered the garden through the
creeper-hung door. We visited the rabbits, and
unchained one of the fox-terriers, which had been
tied up, Simon told us, as a punishment for eating
part of a lace curtain. Bill appeared then and
said that his mother desired us to go to her in the
drawing-room, and, as it was beginning to rain,
Simon agreed that it wasn't a bad idea.
We might even find something to eat in there.</p>

<p>As we trooped past the basement window, I
lingered behind the others, and peered for a
space into the lawless region below. What met
my gaze almost took my breath away: for there
was our own Mary Ellen, who should have been
at that moment cleaning the coal cellar, sitting
at one end of the long table, in her new blue dress,
and plumed hat, a gentleman in livery on either
side of her, and on the table before her, a mug,
which, without doubt, contained gin-and-beer!</p>

<p>I waited to see no more. Enough to know
that all the world was run amuck! With a glad
whoop, I sped after the others, and only drew
up when I stood on the threshold of the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Like the servants' hall, it was a large apartment,
and, like it, was bewildering in its colour
and movement, to eyes accustomed to the grey
decorum of Mrs. Handsomebody's establishment.</p>

<p>Though it was summer, there was a fire on
the hearth, which played with changeful constancy
on the vivid chintzes, silver candle-sticks,
and many mirrors of the room, but most of all,
on the golden hair and satin tea-gown of the
lady in pink.</p>

<p>She was speaking in a loud, clear voice to
Simon's father, who was leaning against the
mantelpiece smoking.</p>

<p>"Why the devil," she was saying, "should you
smoke expensive cigars? Why don't you smoke
cigarettes as I do?"</p>

<p>She angrily puffed at one as she spoke, and
threw herself back among the black and gold
cushions of the divan, where she was sitting.
Her fair brow cleared, however, as her glance
rested on The Seraph.</p>

<p>"Adorable little toad!" she cried, drawing him
to her side. "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Alexander," replied our youngest, "but they
call me The Seraph. I'm not a pampud pet."</p>

<p>This sent the lady into a gale of laughter. She
hugged him closer and turned to me.</p>

<p>"And what is your name, Sobersides?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"John," I replied, "and my father is David
Curzon, and he is an engineer in South America,
but he's coming back to England some day, and, I
expect then we shall go to school. We just live
with Mrs. Handsomebody."</p>

<p>As I talked, her expression changed. She
leaned forward, searching my face eagerly.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" she said, in a tragic voice.
"Is it possible? David Curzon. His son.
The very spit of him!" Abruptly she broke
into gay laughter, which, somehow, I did not
quite like: and turning to her husband, she said:
"Do you remember Davy Curzon? He was
such a silly old pet. Lor'! I'd quite forgot
him!"</p>

<p>"Lucky Davy," said the gentleman, smiling at
me.</p>

<p>"And he was so ridiculously poor," she went
on, "I remember he ruined himself once to buy
me a pair of cream-coloured ponies, and a lapis-lazuli
necklace. And I daresay he's <i>fat</i> now!"</p>

<p>"He is not," I retorted stoutly. "He's thin.
He's had the fever."</p>

<p>"Again?" she cried. "He had it when I knew
him&mdash;badly too. Who did he marry?"</p>

<p>"A Miss Vicars," replied her husband.
"Good family. A screaming beauty too. Other
two boys look like her."</p>

<p>But the lady had now, it seemed, no interest
in the other two boys. The Seraph was deposed
from his place on the divan to make room for
me; and the lady begged me to give her a kiss,
just for old times' sake. Yet, somehow, I did
not quite like it, for I felt that she was making
fun of my father, the hero of my dreams.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other children, unchided, were
making things lively in their own way. Mops
and the boys were eating dates from a bowl and
pelting each other with the stones, while a new
member of the family, a seemingly sexless being
in a blue sash and shoulder knots, called "Baby,"
galloped up and down the room with a battledore
and shuttlecock.</p>


<h4>VII</h4>

<p>No servant announced her name. I felt no
warning tremor of solid Earth beneath my feet.
Yet there she was, in full equipment of bombazine
dress, hard black bonnet, reticule, and umbrella,
gripped like an avenging sword. Oh,
that some merciful cloud might have swept us,
like fair Iphigenia to the abode of the gods, and
left three soft-eyed hinds in our stead!</p>

<p>Yet, there we were, gazing at her, spellbound:
and presently she enunciated with awful distinctness:</p>

<p>"I am come to apologize for the intrusion of
my wards upon your privacy, and to remove them
instantly."</p>

<p>"Oh, bless you," said the lady in pink, cheerily,
"three or four more don't matter to us. Won't
you sit down? And children&mdash;please let the
lady's things be, d'you hear?" for these intrepid
children had gathered around Mrs. Handsomebody
as though she were a dancing bear; and
"Baby" had even pulled her umbrella from her
hand substituting for it the battledore which
Mrs. Handsomebody unconsciously held, with an
effect of ferocious playfulness.</p>

<p>"I thank you," replied Mrs. Handsomebody.
"I shall remain standing."</p>

<p>"Let me make you acquainted with my husband,"
pursued the lady, "he's Lord Simon de
Lacey, second son of the Duke of Aberfalden.
Please excuse him smokin'!"</p>

<p>The effect of these simple words on Mrs. Handsomebody
was startling. She brandished the
battledore as though to ward off the approaching
Lord Simon, and repeated in a trembling
voice:</p>

<p>"Lord Simon de Lacey&mdash;Duke of Aberfalden.
Surely there is some mistake."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said Lord Simon, shaking
her hand. "In me you behold the traditional,
impecunious younger son, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it will not always be so," interrupted
Lady Simon, shouting to make herself heard,
"for, you see, my husband's older brother is an
invalid who will never marry, so we shall inherit
the dukedom and estates one day. This child&mdash;"
pointing to young Simon&mdash;"is a future duke."</p>

<p>"He has a lovely brow," said Mrs. Handsomebody,
beaming at him.</p>

<p>Indeed, an astounding change had come over
our governess. No longer was her manner
frigid; her face, so grey and hard, had softened
till it seemed to radiate benevolence. She
beamed at Bill and Bunny playing at leap-frog
before her chair; she beamed at "Baby," galloping
astride of her umbrella; she beamed at Mops,
trying to force a date into the mouth of a struggling
fox-terrier; she even beamed at me when I
caught her eye.</p>

<p>"I trust that your father, the Duke, keeps
well," she said to Lord Simon.</p>

<p>"Great old boy," he replied. "Never misses
a meet. Been in at the death of nearly four
thousand foxes."</p>

<p>"Ah, blood will tell," breathed Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"You see," interposed Lady Simon, "the Duke
disinherited my husband when he married me.
Didn't approve of the Profession. I was Miss
Dulcie June, awfully well known. Photographs
all over the place. Danced at the Gaiety,
y'know."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I have heard of you," said Mrs.
Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"Well, the Duke and I ran into each other at a
dog show last week, and he was so struck with
me, he asked to be introduced, and has asked us
all to visit him at Falden Castle. It looks hopeful,
don't it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes. But we shall be very sorry to
lose you. It is so difficult for me to find suitable
companions for my wards, and your children are
so&mdash;spirited. Of course, blood will tell."</p>

<p>"Just what I say," assented Lady Simon, "for
I was a spirited girl, if ever there was one.
What with late hours, and toe-dancin' and high-kickin',
it's a wonder how I stood it. I think I
was like that Sir Galahad chap whose 'strength
was as the strength of ten'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doubtless because your art was pure, my
love," put in Lord Simon, with a sly smile.</p>

<p>"I used to know this boy's father in those
days," went on Lady Simon. "He was a lamb."</p>

<p>"He was also my pupil in his youth," said Mrs.
Handsomebody, and the two talked on in the
happiest fashion, till we took our leave, the whole
family following us to the door, and "Baby" returning
Mrs. Handsomebody's umbrella, and relieving
her of the battledore without her having
been aware of the negotiation.</p>

<p>So we who had expected to be haled to retribution,
as criminals of the deepest dye, floated
homeward in the serene light of Mrs. Handsomebody's
approval.</p>

<p>No one spoke till the Cathedral came in view.
Then Angel said:</p>

<p>"There's a window in the Cathedral in memory
of a son of some Duke of Aberfalden. He died
about a hundred years ago."</p>

<p>"The very same family," replied our governess,
"and, I am sure, from now on, my dear boy, you
will regard the window with a new reverence."</p>

<p>"You must have noticed," she proceeded, "the
geniality and dignity that emanated from each
separate member of that noble family. This is
admirably expressed by the French in the saying&mdash;'Noblesse
oblige'&mdash;meaning that nobility has
its obligations. Repeat the phrase after me,
David, that you may acquire a perfect accent."</p>

<p>"Knob-less obleedge," repeated Angel, submissively;
and The Seraph also repeated it several
times, as though storing it away for future use.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Handsomebody rang the door-bell,
I trembled for Mary Ellen, remembering where
I had last seen her, but the admirable girl
promptly opened the door to us, clad in the drabbest
of her cellar-cleaning garb, a smudge of soot
on her rosy cheek.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody ordered sardines for tea,
and had the silver tea-pot brought out. She also
dressed for the occasion, adding a jet bracelet,
seldom seen, to her toilet.</p>

<p>All went well, till, at bedtime, The Seraph
could not be found. Becoming alarmed, Mrs.
Handsomebody, at last, opened the door of the
forbidden parlour, Angel and I peering from behind
her, hoping, yet fearing, to discover the
recreant.</p>

<p>Truly the gods had a mind to The Seraph.
His was ever the cream of every adventure.
There he was, lolling at ease, in a tasselled velvet
chair, just beneath the portrait of Mr. Handsomebody.
Lolling at ease, and smoking a
gold-tipped cigarette, which, he afterwards confessed,
he had got from Bill, in trade for a piece
of India-rubber.</p>

<p>Like an old-timer he handled it, watching the
smoke-wreaths above his head with the tranquil
gaze of an elderly club-man.</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" screamed Mrs. Handsomebody,
clutching Angel and me for support.
"Are you demented, Alexander? Do you realize
what you are doing?"</p>

<p>The Seraph drew a long puff, looking straight
into her eyes, before he replied: then, in a tone
of gentle seriousness, he said:</p>

<p>"Knob-less obleedge."</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch9">Chapter IX: The Cobbler And
His Wife</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Bootlaces had become of immense importance
to us, since a lack of them always meant a visit to
the cobbler to buy new ones. They were comparatively
easy to break, or to tie in knots that even
Mary Ellen's strong fingers could not undo.
Then there were tongues. One could always dislocate
a tongue. At any rate, the boots of one of
the three were always needing attention.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" our governess would exclaim,
wrathfully, "Another heel off! One would think
you did it purposely. And boots such a price!
Just think of your poor father in South America,
working day in and day out to provide you with
boots, which you treat with no more consideration
than if they were horseshoes&mdash;well, to the cobbler's
then&mdash;and tell him to mind his charges. It
should cost no more than sixpence."</p>

<p>The cobbler lived in the tiniest of a group of
tiny houses that huddled together, in a panicky
fashion, in a narrow street behind Mrs. Handsomebody's
house. From an upper window we
could look down on their roofs, where the plump,
Cathedral pigeons used to congregate to gossip
and sun themselves.</p>

<p>You went down three stone steps into the cobbler's
shop. There he always sat at work by his
bench, tapping away at the sole of a shoe, or
stitching leather with his strange needle. His
hands fascinated us by their coat of smooth oily
dirt. Never cleaner, never dirtier, always the
same useful, glove-like covering. Did he go to
bed with them so? How jolly! we thought. His
face, too, was of extraordinary interest. It was
so thin that the sharp bones could be seen beneath
the dusky skin, and he would twitch his nostrils
at the breeze that came in his open window, for
all the world like an eager brown hare. His hair
curled so tightly over his head that one knew he
could never pull a comb through it, and we were
sure he was far too sensible to try.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody said he was half gypsy,
and not to be encouraged. Mary Ellen said,
God help him with that wife of his.</p>

<p>He bred canaries.</p>

<p>All about the low window their wooden cages
hung. Even from the darkest corners of the
shop bursts of song leaped like little flames and
yellow breasts bloomed like daffodils. When
the cobbler tapped a shoe with his hammer, they
sang loudest, making a wild and joyous din.</p>

<p>Thus they were all busy together when we entered
on this winter morning, carrying Angel's
heelless boot, wrapped in a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Martindale," said Angel,
above the din, "you see I've got another heel off,
so I'm wearing my Sunday boots, and Mrs. Handsomebody
says it shouldn't be above sixpence,
please."</p>

<p>The cobbler ceased his tapping, and all the
birds stopped to listen:</p>

<p>"Good-morning, little masters," he said, in
his soft voice. "What wild things your feet are
to be sure. Try as I will, I cannot tame them.
You might as well try to keep three wild ponies
shod." He undid the parcel and turned the boot
over in his hands. "Sixpence, did she say?
Nay, tell her a shilling, for the sole needs stitching
as well."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must keep that for another day,"
said Angel, "so we can come again."</p>

<p>"How she tries to keep you down," said the
cobbler. "How old are you now?"</p>

<p>I replied to this. "Angel's ten, and I'm nine,
and The Seraph's six."</p>

<p>"Just the brave age for the woods. I wish I
had my old van again, and could take you on the
road with me. You'd learn something of forest
ways in no time. Shall you wait for this?"</p>

<p>Wait for it? Rather. We established ourselves about him; The Seraph climbed beside him
on the bench; Angel took possession of his tools,
handing them to him as required; while I busied
myself in plentifully oiling a strip of leather.
The birds chirped and pecked above our heads.</p>

<p>Angel asked: "Did you do much cobbling in
the van, Mr. Martindale?"</p>

<p>"Ay, cobbling and tinkering too. The forest
birds liked to hear me just the same as those
canaries. Especially the tinkering. They'd
crowd about and sing fit to burst their throats&mdash;wood-thrushes,
finches, and all sorts. Then, I
used to stop at village fairs and take in a nice bit
of silver. For my missus could play the concertina,
and I had a cage of lovebirds that could tell
fortunes and do tricks."</p>

<p>A strange voice spoke from the passage behind
the shop.</p>

<p>"Ay. Comical tricks lovebirds do. And
cruel tricks, love. I've been tricked by 'em."</p>

<p>"Better lie down, Ada," said Martindale.
"Or make tea. That'll quiet ye." He rose and
went to the door, closing it softly. But he had
barely seated himself again, when there came a
scream from the passage.</p>

<p>"Look what you've did, you villain, you've shut
me in the door! Oh! oh! I'm trapped in this
comical passage! Loose me quick!"</p>

<p>Martindale sprang to the door, where a strip of
red petticoat showed that his wife was indeed
caught, and went out into the passage, speaking
in a soothing tone, and leading her away.</p>

<p>"I fink I'll go," whispered The Seraph.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," I assured him, "the cobbler
will take care she don't hurt us."</p>

<p>"She's a character, isn't she?" said Angel, borrowing
a phrase from Mary Ellen.</p>

<p>Martindale returned then, sat down on his
bench, and, smoothing his leather apron, resumed
his work with composure.</p>

<p>"I fink," said The Seraph, "I hear Mrs. Handsomebody
calling. I better be off."</p>

<p>"Bide a little while," said Martindale, "and
I'll tell you a first rate story&mdash;about birds too.
Then you'll forget your fright, little master, eh?"</p>

<p>The Seraph moved closer to him, and the
canaries burst into a fury of song.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful what birds know," he began.
"News flies as fast among 'em as wind on the
heath, and if you do an injury to one, the others'll
never forgive it. For though they may fight
among themselves, they'll all join together against
one wicked cruel man."</p>

<p>The canaries ceased their singing, and fluttered
against the bars.</p>

<p>"Just look at Coppertoes," said the cobbler,
pointing to a large ruffled bird, "he's heard this
tale often afore, yet it always excites him. He'll
peck at his perch; and beat his wings for hours
after it. Won't you, my pet?"</p>

<p>Coppertoes crouched on his perch, his beak
open, making little hissing sounds.</p>

<p>"Well, there was a man," went on the cobbler,
"a student fellow he was, who was always making
queer messes with chemicals, and fancying he was
about to discover some wonderful new combination.
He lived in a top room in a high, narrow
house, well on towards three hundred years ago.
And all those years, a family of song-sparrows,
and their descendants, had nested under the eaves
directly above his window. Hatched out their
young; fed them; and taught them to fly. Very
well. This student fellow was all in a fever one
morning because he believed that, at last, his
great discovery was all but perfect. Just a few
hours more and he would have it in the hollow of
his hand. But he could not rightly fasten his
brain to work because of the constant cheeping
of the young sparrows under the eaves. Every
time the mother bird brought them a moth or
worm they raised a chorus of yells; and when
she flew away, they cheeped for her to come back
again.</p>

<p>"The student-fellow shut his window, but it did
not keep out the noise. Then he flung open the
window and waved his arms and shouted at them.
But they only cheeped the louder. Now a dreadful rage took hold on him. With his heart full
of murder, he fetched a basin in which he had
put some poisonous drug. He set fire to this and
set it on the window sill just below the nest.
Then, with a triumphal smile, he shut the window
fast, leaving the fledglings to perish in the fumes
that rose, thick and deadly from the basin.</p>

<p>"For hours he worked, and, at last, to his
great joy, he figured out the amazing problem
that was to be a gain to the whole world. He
was so tired that he clean forgot the little birds,
and flung himself, face down, on his bed to rest.
He did not wake until the next morning at seven.
It was so dark that he had to strike a light to
see the face of his watch. Now he knew that it
should not be dark at either seven in the morning
or seven at night; and he felt very strange. The
room was full of the unclean smells of his chemicals,
and he groped his way to the window to get
air. But the outdoor air was murky and he saw
that a heavy cloud had settled just above the
chimney pots. This cloud seemed to palpitate,
as though made of a million beating wings.
Down below he could hear the clatter of wooden
clogs on the cobble stones, as people were running
in a panic to the Town Hall. The big bell of it
began to ring, but in a muffled way as though
borne down by the cloud. The student guessed
that a meeting was being called.</p>

<p>"He remembered the sparrows then, and he
craned his neck to see the nest. There was the
little mother-bird sitting in the nest with her
wings outstretched to protect the nestlings from
the deadly fumes. Her beak was wide open and
she was quite dead."</p>

<p>The Seraph's breast heaved and his tears began
to drop on the cobbler's leather apron.
Coppertoes squatted beneath his swing, striking
it angrily with his shoulders so that it swung
violently. All the other birds were silent.</p>

<p>Steadily working at the shoe the cobbler proceeded:
"The terrible truth was borne to the
student then, and he knew that the cock sparrow,
on finding his mate and her young ones thus foully
murdered, had flown swiftly to the king of all
the birds, and told him of the deed. The king
had summoned great battalions of birds, from
fierce eagles and owls (these last rushing from
their dark hiding places) down to fluttering little
wrens and tomtits. 'Twas of those that the
great cloud was made, and it hung just over the
town like a dark wave that would soon smother
the townsfolk.</p>

<p>"The student caught up the paper where he
had writ the great discovery and made for the
street, running along with the rest of the folk,
and ready to drop with fear of the great press of
wings above them. When he got to the Town
Hall, he found the whole town huddled together
there, even new mothers with their babes, like
young birds; and, in a moment the beadle had
swung the great doors shut. In there they could
scarce see each other's fearful faces; but the
student clumb up on the council table, and he told
out bravely enough how it was all his doing, and
since he had brought it to pass, he was prepared
to go out and face the birds alone.</p>

<p>"But first he handed over the paper to the
Mayor, and charged him to guard it stoutly, for
it was about the most precious thing on earth.
Then he called&mdash;'Good-bye! friends,' and went,
since there was no time to spare; for the birds
were beginning to hammer like hail on the windows
with their beaks, especially the cranes and
flamingos.</p>

<p>"When the door had clanged behind him the
women mourned aloud, for they knew they would
never see him again. A great tumult rose outside
as of a hurricane, and it grew pitch dark.
After a spell, the noise ceased, and the cloud
lifted, and a shaft of sunlight slanted across the
hall. The village tailor opened the door, for
the mayor and the beadle were sore afeared.
There was not a bird in sight, though the ground
was inches deep in feathers they had dropped.
As for the student, no one ever saw him again.
Whether the birds had carried him off bodily to
some secret place, or whether they had torn him
piecemeal, no one knew."</p>

<p>The Seraph sniffled. "It's nice and twagic,"
he said.</p>

<p>"What became of his great discovery?" asked
Angel.</p>

<p>"Ay, you may well ask that. Why, the mayor
said it was bewitched and held it in the flame of
a candle till there was naught left of it but cinders....
Now, here is your boot, little master,
good as new, and the cost but one shilling."</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>When we entered the house, we heard voices
in the parlour, and found our governess there,
superintending Mary Ellen at work. Mary Ellen
was carefully brushing and dusting the plumage
of the stuffed birds.</p>

<p>I stared with a new interest at those feathered
members of our household, who held themselves
so coldly aloof from the rest of us; asking neither
gift of chickweed nor of sugar, disdaining the
very air we breathed. Who knew but that yonder
sad-eyed hawk had helped to tear the student!
"Piecemeal" the cobbler's word for it&mdash;one could
picture him with some bloody fragment, shooting
straight upward, his wide pinions spread.</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody was speaking in a complaining
way to Angel.</p>

<p>"A shilling! 'Tis ridiculous. For such a
paltry piece of work. I shall go around that
way when we take our walk and protest against
such extortion. I said sixpence to you when you
set out."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Angel, "but he said it was
worth a shilling."</p>

<p>"You see, he has a wife to keep," put in The
Seraph, "and live birds to feed."</p>

<p>Mary Ellen withdrew her head from the interior
of the glass case.</p>

<p>"Oh'm," she said, very red in the face, "it's
thrue that Misther Martindale needs every penny
he can lay hands on, for his wife is no good to
him at all, and he has to hire a charwoman to
clane up for her."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mrs. Handsomebody, "I shall
seek a shoemaker who has no such encumbrance.
Is the woman feeble-minded or a sloven?"</p>

<p>"Faith, she's both 'm, and ivery day she's gettin'
worse than she do be. I've heard her say
sich things whin I've been in the shop that me
very sowl-case shivered."</p>

<p>"What sort of things?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mary Ellen, circling her duster
on the glasses, so that she might still be said to
be working as she talked, "the other day whin I
called for me slippers wid the satin bows on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I disapprove of those bows."</p>

<p>"&mdash;She was in the passage beyant, and just
the voice of her came through the crack o' the
dure. She says, says she: 'If a body was to fall&mdash;an'
fall&mdash;an' fall&mdash;and there was naught to
stop him, it's comical to think where he'd light
on.'... Her voice was as solemn as the church
organ, 'm. Another day she says: 'If I could
only git the moon out of this passage, there'd be
room for my head to whirl round and round!'
'Excuse me,' I says to the cobbler, 'I'll call for
thim shoes later.'"</p>

<p>"What appearance has she?" inquired Mrs.
Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"Noan at all. I've niver seed her. No one
has ever seed her. She's more banshee than
woman, I do belave."</p>

<p>True to her threat, Mrs. Handsomebody
stopped at the cobbler's that afternoon, at the
outset of our accustomed promenade. The birds
were in full chorus as we descended the steps into
the shop.</p>

<p>The cobbler got to his feet, and touched his
forehead respectfully. This pleased Mrs. Handsomebody.</p>

<p>"My good man," she said, "You have sadly
overcharged me for putting a new heel on this
child's boot. I said, when I sent it that it was
worth sixpence&mdash;"</p>

<p>The cobbler opened his mouth to speak.</p>

<p>&mdash;"Now, don't interrupt," continued Mrs.
Handsomebody. "I shall not ask you to refund
the sixpence; but I have brought a prunella gaiter
of my own which needs stitching, and I shall expect
you to do it, without extra charge, if you
wish to retain the patronage of my household."</p>

<p>Here was a test of manhood! Would Martindale,
a full-grown male, submit to being bullied
by a creature who wore a bustle, and a black silk
apron? Alas, for the whiskered sex! He took
his medicine; just as we, hedged in some fateful
corner, gulped down our castor oil. Turning
the gaiter over in his dark hands, he meekly assented.
Mrs. Handsomebody, appeased by her
easy victory, inquired after his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, poorly as usual, thank you ma'am," he
said.</p>

<p>"I should think that country life would be much
better for her."</p>

<p>"She's even worse in the country."</p>

<p>"There was a sheet of an excellent religious
paper wrapped about that gaiter. You might
give it to her to read."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am, I will, though she takes
more comfort reading the dream-book than anything."</p>

<p>"Burn the dream-book. It is probably at the
root of the trouble."</p>

<p>"No," replied the cobbler, slowly, "It all began
when we lost our daughter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody was touched. "That is
sad indeed. How old was the child?"</p>

<p>"Just two days old, ma'am. We were camping
in a forest when she was born, and I had
laid her in a little hammock among the birds, and
some gypsies must have stolen her, for when I
came back she was gone. She'd be eighteen
now." He stroked his leather apron with trembling
hands, at the same time giving me a curious
look of appeal. So when Mrs. Handsomebody,
after a few words of sympathy made a movement
to go, I developed a strange pain in the leg, that
made walking an impossibility. She consented
that I should rest a while at the cobbler's, and
then return home carrying the gaiter.</p>

<p>When Martindale and I were left alone, he
cautiously opened the door into the passage,
peered out, and then returned. He said softly:</p>

<p>"Little Master, I've got to get rid of Coppertoes.
She's turned against him. She says he
comes out of his cage of nights, and flies about
the house, pecking at the food, and trying to
make a nest in her hair. She says he stole a
golden sovereign of hers and hid it in an old
shoe. Isn't it a shame, and he such a lovely
bird?"</p>

<p>"It's awful," I agreed. "What shall you do?"</p>

<p>"I know a man who will buy him, but he is out
of town till tomorrow. Could I depend on you,
little master, to keep him for me till then? If
he is left here the misses will do him an injury."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Handsomebody&mdash;" I faltered.</p>

<p>"Just put him in some out o' the way corner
with a cloth over his cage, and a lump of sugar.
He'll be quiet as can be, and 'twill soon be
dark&mdash;"</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>With a delicious sense of secrecy, I stole past
the Cathedral. Pressed against my breast was
the cage that held Coppertoes. He sat quietly
on his perch, very long, and slender, and bright-eyed
with amazement at this sudden excursion
into a new world. I wondered what he thought
of the towering Cathedral, shrouded in a film of
hoar frost that lent its ancient stones a bloom
as delicate as the petals of flowers.</p>

<p>Three pigeons hopped daintily down the
shallow stone steps, cocking their heads inquisitively
at the bird in the cage. I shouted at them,
and they rose slowly to the tower above.</p>

<p>Silent indeed was the hall when I entered.
Only the clock ticked ponderously. The house
was cold, and Coppertoes seemed suddenly very
fragile. How lonely he would be! I stared at
the closed door of the parlour, thinking what a
shame that the stuffed birds in there were not
alive, so they might be company for him. Still&mdash;he
was very young&mdash;and had not seen much
of the world. Might he not be made to believe
that they were a foreign breed that never chirped
or left their perches? Anything was better than
the dark and loneliness. And if he chose to sing
I was sure he could not be heard through that
heavy door.</p>

<p>Like a ghost I went in and shut the door behind
me.</p>

<p>I held his wicker cage against the glass case.
"Coppertoes," I whispered, "Other birds!
Aren't they pretty? Want to get in an' play
with them, old chap? See the pretty oriole?
An' the owl, Coppertoes. Lovebirds, too. Want
to get in, little fellow? Such a bully big cage you
never saw."</p>

<p>I opened the door of the glass case, and cautiously
introduced the bird cage. I opened the
door of the cage. Coppertoes paid no heed but
busied himself in pecking sharply at his lump of
sugar. I urged him with my finger but still he
refused to see the door. Then I took away his
sugar, and poked him. With a light and careless
hop he was on the threshold. He cocked
his head. He spied the oriole.</p>

<p>An instant later he was at its throat. Feathers
flew. He was back again on the roof of his
cage spitting feathers out of his mouth. More
feathers sailed slowly through the heavy air.
Then he spied the lovebirds. With passionate
fury he attacked them both at once, tearing their
plumage impartially; his eye already selecting the
next victim.</p>

<p>Though my heart thumped with apprehension,
my mouth was stretched in a broad grin. I felt
that I should never tire of the spectacle before
me. I realized that I had always hated the
stuffed birds.</p>

<p>Coppertoes was busy with the owl, when a
piercing scream came from behind me. I turned
and found Mrs. Handsomebody gazing with horrified
fascination at the orgy under glass. She
took three steps forward, her eyes starting with
horror.</p>

<p>"Come to life&mdash;" she gasped, in a strangled
voice&mdash;"after all these years&mdash;and gone stark
mad."</p>

<p>She fell, at full length, across the green and
red medallions of the carpet.</p>

<p>Then, with a rush, Mary Ellen and the charwoman,
Mrs. Coe, were upon us, and, after them,
my brothers.</p>

<p>"Lord preserve us!" cried Mary Ellen, bending
above her prostrate mistress, "what has come
over the poor lady to be took like this?"</p>

<p>"Is she dead, do you fink?" asked The Seraph,
on a hopeful note.</p>

<p>"Well, if she is, faith! 'tis yersilves has kilt
her."</p>

<p>"She's just in a swoond," asserted Mrs. Coe,
calmly. "Wot she needs is brandy. Yus, and
terbaccer smoke blowed dahn 'er froat." Mrs.
Handsomebody moaned.</p>

<p>"Better get her out of here," suggested Angel,
his eye on Coppertoes who, sated by bloodshed,
lay with wings outstretched, panting on the floor
of the case.</p>

<p>"Thrue," agreed Mary Ellen. "And shut the
dure afther ye, and make yersilves scarce till tea-time,
like good childer, do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody was borne away by Mary
Ellen and Mrs. Coe, the latter still muttering&mdash;"terbaccer
smoke dahn 'er froat."</p>

<p>We restored Coppertoes to his wicker cage, and
wrapping it in an antimacassar, hid it beneath
the piano.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>We three sat, "making ourselves scarce," on
the topmost of the steps before the front door.
It was only four by the Cathedral clock, which
solemnly struck the hour, but it was almost dark.
It was cold and we pressed closely together for
warmth. The Seraph murmured a little song of
which I caught the words:</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"The birds! The birds!</p>
<p class="i2">He knocked the stuffing</p>
<p class="i2">Out of the stuffed birds!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>We watched the slow progress of the lamplighter
along the street. Like a god, he marched
solemnly, leaving new stars in his wake.</p>

<p>As he raised his wand and touched the lamp
before our house, a new figure appeared beneath
its rays, hurrying darkly towards us. It entered
the gate and came in a stealthy way to where we
sat. We recognized the cobbler.</p>

<p>"Little masters," he whispered. "She's
flitted."</p>

<p>"Good widdance," said The Seraph, briskly.
"She was too comical to be a nice wife."</p>

<p>"Ah, no," replied the cobbler. "She's weak
in her head and bound to come to something
hurtful. I'll not seek my bed this night until
I've found her. I thought mayhap you'd ha' seen
her pass!"</p>

<p>"No," replied Angel. "We didn't. But perhaps
the lamplighter did."</p>

<p>With one accord, we hurried after the retreating
figure. Hearing our footsteps, he turned and
faced us beneath a newly lit lamp. Its serene
radiance fell on his solemn blue-eyed face, surrounded
by red whiskers.</p>

<p>"What's the turmoil?" he asked. "Did I forget
a lamp?"</p>

<p>"Have ye seen a strange-appearing woman?"
asked Martindale. "With a shawl about her,
and mayhap remarking something about the moon,
or a evil-minded canary."</p>

<p>The lamplighter ran his fingers through his
red beard. "She warn't saying naught about
canaries," he affirmed, "but she did say as how
if she could once get the moon in Wumble Pool,
she'd drown it."</p>

<p>"Wumble Pool. That's where she's gone
then. I can't seem to place it."</p>

<p>"It's less nor a mile from here, and since my
last lamp is lit, I'll not mind guiding you so far.
Who be she, this woman?"</p>

<p>"My wife. She's fey, and I'm fearing she'll
drown herself."</p>

<p>"It's a very bad fing to be drowned," put in
The Seraph, as we all set off together. "'Cos a
bath in a tub is wet enough."</p>

<p>What a chill, dark night it was growing! The
Cathedral clock struck a hollow warning note as
we passed. We heard the beat of wings as the
pigeons settled for the night.</p>

<p>The Seraph grasped a hand each of the cobbler
and the lamplighter, taking long manful strides
to keep up with them. We seemed, indeed, a
sinister company setting out on dark adventure.</p>

<p>Hurriedly we traversed narrow, winding
streets, where night had already fallen in the
shadow of clammy walls. Strange and eerie was
the path between wet trees, when we had left the
town behind. The lamplighter with his tall
wand alight seemed like some unearthly messenger
come to conduct us to goblin realms.</p>

<p>We spoke never a word till an open common
lay before us; then the lamplighter pointing with
his wand to a glimmering surface fringed by rank
grass, said:</p>

<p>"Yon's Wumble Pool."</p>

<p>Wumble Pool! The very name struck a chill
to our hearts.</p>

<p>"Yes, and there's the moon," whispered the
cobbler.</p>

<p>It was true that the distorted image of the
moon floated dimly in the Pool, as though it had
indeed been caught by the mad-woman, and
drowned.</p>

<p>"How soft the ground is!" breathed Angel.</p>

<p>"Ay, and the Pool has no bottom," said the
lamplighter.</p>

<p>"I can't think she'd have the heart to do it,"
said Martindale.</p>

<p>The Seraph screamed.</p>

<p>"There she is! I see her! Standing in the
Pool!"</p>

<p>We ran to the brink. A cold air struck our
faces. Our feet sank ankle-deep in the mud.
The cobbler did not stop, but ran on into the
Pool, where the shawled figure of a woman stood,
covered to the waist by the sullen, black water.</p>

<p>"Ada! Ada!" cried the cobbler, throwing his
arms about her.</p>

<p>"Leave me go!" shrieked the woman. "I'm
a-goin' to drownd myself!"</p>

<p>The struggle in the water, shattered the reflection
of the moon like pale amber glass. Once
they both sank into the water; the lamplighter
waving his wand, and shouting. Then, at last,
the four of us bent over them as they lay, huddled,
on the grass at the brink.</p>

<p>"You'd ought to be ashamed of yourself to
worrit your 'usband so," said the lamplighter,
sternly.</p>

<p>"'Usband!" cried the woman, shrilly. "I've
got no 'usband!"</p>

<p>The cobbler gave a cry of fear. He pulled
the shawl from her head and felt the face and
hair.</p>

"God's truth!" he muttered, "I've saved the
wrong woman."

<p>"Better fwow her back again," suggested The
Seraph.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, little man," said the lamplighter,
holding his light close to her face. "That would
never do. Besides, her be young and winsome."</p>

<p>"I'd keep her," said Angel.</p>

<p>"Whoever are you, lass?" asked Martindale,
in a trembling voice, "and why did you plan to
make way with yourself?"</p>

<p>The moon shone wanly on the girl's face and
wet hair.</p>

<p>"I'm nobody," she wailed, "and I be tired of
life."</p>

<p>"Did you see aught of a strange woman?"
asked Martindale. "One who was talking about
the moon, and her head a-whirling?"</p>

<p>"She came right down the road ahead of me,"
she answered, in a weak voice, "and ran straight
into the pool. When she was in, she grabbed
the floating image of the moon, and she said:
'I've got you, at last, you comical villain!' And
she laughed, and seemed to struggle with it, and
she went down."</p>

<p>"That'd be her, all right," said the lamplighter.</p>

<p>"Ada mine, Ada mine," mourned Martindale.</p>

<p>Angel and The Seraph and I clutched hands,
and looked shudderingly into Wumble Pool.</p>

<p>"That seemed to scare me like," went on the
girl, "and I couldn't jump right in, but I just
crept, a step at a time, fearing I'd step on the
body."</p>

<p>"No danger," said The Seraph complacently,
"there's no bottom."</p>

<p>"One thing is certain," pronounced the lamplighter,
"this young 'ooman should have some
hot spirits in her inside, and be wrapped in a
warm blanket, afore she's starved with the cold."</p>

<p>First we walked all around Wumble Pool, and
poked it with sticks, but there was no sign of the
cobbler's wife. Then, slowly, we retraced our
steps to the town, the two men supporting the
dripping girl.</p>

<p>A lamp burned with a ruddy glow in the room
behind the shop, where all the birds were sleeping.
Martindale put his charge in a chair by the
hearth, and made gin-and-beer hot for everybody.
The Seraph kissed the girl, and she said that she
was glad after all that she was safe out of Wumble
Pool.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my dear?" questioned
Martindale.</p>

<p>"I don't know my name rightly, sir, for I was
stole by gipsies when I was but two days old."</p>

<p>The cobbler gave a cry and set down his glass.
"Gipsies&mdash;two days' old&mdash;" he stammered.
Then he pushed back the thick hair, about her
ear. "Yes, yes!" pointing to a tiny slit in the
lobe, "there is the very place,&mdash;where one of my
jealous birds pecked her the day she was born!"
He caught her in his arms and held her, mystified
but happy&mdash;.</p>

<p>The reunion was interrupted by a pounding at
the door. It was a furious Mary Ellen, her
night out completely spoiled by the search for us.</p>

<p>Thus we were haled before Mrs. Handsomebody,
questioned, upbraided, and given, at last,
a bowl of hot gruel apiece.</p>

<p>"You deserve," she said bitterly, "to go empty
to bed, but my conscience forbids that I relax my
vigilance over your health. Tomorrow, we
shall see what can be done in the way of discipline."</p>

<p>We sat on three high-backed haircloth chairs.
The steaming gruel slipped thickly into our stomachs.
The hot gin had gone to our heads. Mrs.
Handsomebody's head looked abnormally large
to me, and seemed to be whirling round and
round. Surely she was not getting like the cobbler's
wife! Mrs. Handsomebody was still
scolding:</p>

<p>"You began the day by introducing a canary
of the lowest proclivities into my case of stuffed
birds, where he perpetrated irreparable damage&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Seraph interrupted, "Don't you yike live
birds, Mrs. Handsomebody?"</p>

<p>"I prefer stuffed birds to live ones, I confess."</p>

<p>The Seraph said apologetically: "And I pwefer
gin to gwuel&mdash;any day."</p>

<p>"Gin! Where did you taste gin?"</p>

<p>Without reply The Seraph hurried on, while
Angel and I scraped our bowls:</p>

<p>"There was once a student fellow and he didn't
yike live birds, either. He poisoned one and it
died. Then he undertook a walk (this was a
favourite expression of Mrs. Handsomebody's)
and all the other birds pounced on him and tore
him piecemeal."</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody, with a ferocious gleam
in her eye, leaned forward to catch the rest.
The Seraph's voice was low and insinuating.</p>

<p>"I was finking"&mdash;with a chuckle&mdash;"that you
might poison one of the nicest of the stuffed birds.
Then you might get in the glass case wiv the
others. We could lock the door on the outside
and watch through the glass."</p>

<p>"And I expect you think they would tear <i>me</i>
piecemeal? Is that the idea?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," chuckled The Seraph.
"But suppose you twy it."</p>

<br /><br />


<h2><i><a name="ch10">Chapter X: The New Day</a></i></h2>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>I think we must have felt that he was coming,
for we awoke at dawn that morning. I could
barely see the silvery bars between the slats of
the shutters. The Seraph was stirring in his
sleep, and in a moment he whispered: "I say,
John, what's that long black thing behind the
door?"</p>

<p>"Just some clothes hung up," I whispered back.</p>

<p>"I fought they moved," he said. "Do you
fink the wardrobe door moved, John?"</p>

<p>"Everything seems a little queer this morning,"
I replied. "I heard a whispering sort of noise
at the shutters a bit ago."</p>

<p>Angel began to talk in his sleep.</p>

<p>"If three suns were to rise at six," he muttered,
"how many stars would it take to make a
moon?"</p>

<p>The Seraph began to laugh delightedly. He
kicked his legs and showed all his little white
teeth. Angel opened his eyes and stared at us
crossly. "What a beastly row," he said. "I
want to sleep some more."</p>

<p>The silver bars between the slats of the shutters
took a golden tinge. Clearly it was to be
a fine day, after a week of rain and sleet.</p>

<p>The chimes of the Cathedral sounded. The
notes came with penetrating sweetness as though
the air were cold and clear. We heard the door
of Mary Ellen's room open; she descended the
back stairs noisily.</p>

<p>The Seraph turned a somersault in the middle
of the bed.</p>

<p>"Cwistmas is coming," he said, trying to stand
on his head, "and I want a pony."</p>

<p>We threw ourselves into a general scuffle, and
the old-four-poster creaked and the bolster fell
to the floor.</p>

<p>Then up the cavernous backstairs came the
peal of the front door bell. We heard Mary
Ellen drop the poker and run through the house.
It was an unheard of hour for the front door
bell to ring. We sat up in bed in stiffened attitudes
of expectancy. Mary Ellen was mounting
the front stair. She rapped loudly at Mrs.
Handsomebody's bedroom door. There were
whispers. Then Mrs. Handsomebody's voice
came decidedly:</p>

<p>"Go about your work with the utmost speed.
Say nothing to the boys of this. I shall tell
them when they have had their breakfast."</p>

<p>In a moment she appeared at our door in her
purple dressing-gown, an expression of repressed
excitement on her face. A sunbeam slanting
through the passage rested on the fringe of curl-papers
about her head so that she looked like
some elderly saint wearing a rather ragged halo.</p>

<p>"I have received news," she announced, with
more than usual firmness, "which will make it
necessary for us to rise immediately. Dress as
quickly as you can, and help your little brother.
What a state you have got that bed into! You
deserve to be punished." She stood for a
moment, her eyes resting on us with a curious
look, then, with a sigh, she turned away and went
back to her room.</p>

<p>At breakfast she still wore her dressing-gown,
an unprecedented laxity. Beside her on the table-cloth
lay a crumpled piece of buff paper. So it
was by telegram that the news had come. Instantly
I thought. The telegram is from father.
He is coming home. Maybe he is on his way.
In London even! The food would not go down
my throat. Shudders of excitement shook me.</p>

<p>I looked at Angel. Taking advantage of Mrs.
Handsomebody's absorption he was spreading a
second spoonful of sugar over his porridge.
The Seraph was staring, spoon in hand, into Mrs.
Handsomebody's set face. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Handsomebody, if I was to smile at you,
would you smile back at me?"</p>

<p>"Alexander," replied Mrs. Handsomebody,
"I hope I have never been found wanting in courtesy.
But, at present, I should prefer to see you
eat your breakfast with as much speed as possible.
John, eat your porridge."</p>

<p>"I can't, please."</p>

<p>"Eat it instantly, sir."</p>

<p>"I can't," I repeated, beginning to blubber, "I
want to see father!"</p>

<p>"Eat your porridge and you shall see him.
He will be here at ten o'clock. Silence, now, no
uproar. My nerves are under quite enough
strain." She poured herself fresh tea, and continued:</p>

<p>"There will be no tasks today. After breakfast
you will put on your best jackets and collars,
and sit in the parlour until he arrives. I implore
you to be as composed as possible."</p>

<p>The questions that poured from us were
hushed by a gesture of her inflexible, white hand.
Dazed by the news, we were herded back to our
bedroom, hurried into stiff white collars and
hustled into shining Sunday shoes. There was
the sound of cold water tinkling in the basin; of
straining bootlaces; and of the creaking of a
loose board in the floor every time Mary Ellen
stepped on it. Scarcely a word was spoken.
Now that what we had so long strained towards
was at hand we stood breathless before the immensity of it. The long year and nine months
at Mrs. Handsomebody's fell like a heavy curtain
between us and the past. Our father's face had
grown hazy to us. I think The Seraph only pretended
to remember. His coming had been held
over our heads so long, as a time of swift retribution,
that a feeling of doubt, almost terror,
mingled with our joy.</p>

<p>At last we were ready. With shining faces,
burning ears, and quickly tapping hearts, we went
soberly down the stairs. The door of the parlour
stood wide open. Mrs. Handsomebody,
herself, was dusting the case of stuffed birds,
whose plumage, sadly thinned by the attentions
of Coppertoes, seemed to quiver with expectancy.</p>

<p>We were instructed to wait inside the iron
gate, at the front, until train time, when we were
to be recalled to the parlour, and take our places
on three chairs, already ranged in a row for us.
Thus we were to be displayed by Mrs. Handsomebody,
to our sire.</p>

<p>We found Granfa polishing the brass on the
front door, his white locks bobbing as he rubbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Granfa," we cried, "have you heard the
news?"</p>

<p>"Ess fay," he replied, straightening his back,
"for thiccy Mary Ellen came a-galloping at top
speed to ask me to shine the brasses for 'ee, knowing I have a wonderful art that way. The poor
Zany was all in a mizmaze."</p>

<p>"Are you glad father's coming?"</p>

<p>"Glad! I be so joyful as a bulfinch in springtime.
See how the very face of Natur' be lit up
for the grand occasion."</p>

<p>The sky had, indeed, become deeply blue, and
a great pink cloud hung above the Cathedral like
a welcoming banner. There had been frost in
the night forming thin ice over the puddles in the
road. All those reflected the serene pink of the
cloud, a blue pigeon picked his way delicately
among them. A sweet-smelling wind swayed the
moist brown limbs of the elm trees. All the
world seemed like a great organ attuned to joy.</p>

<p>"Suppose," suggested Angel, "that we just race
around to the cobbler's and tell him the news.
The Dragon is too busy to miss us."</p>

<p>The very thing! It would take only a few
minutes and would be something to do to pass
the time. Softly we slipped through the iron
gate; lightly we hastened along the shining wet
street; under the shadow of the Cathedral, whose
spire seemed to taper to the sky; down narrow,
winding Henwood Street till we reached the cobbler's
shop.</p>

<p>Martindale was standing in the open door his
face raised as though he were drinking in the
fragrance of the morning. A chorus of bird
song came from inside.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Mr. Martindale," Angel shouted.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose? Father's coming
home."</p>

<p>"He'll be here In less than two hours," I
panted.</p>

<p>The cobbler put a dark hand on a shoulder of
each. "That's grand news, little masters," he
said. "But I hope he won't take you so far away
that I shall never see you. The birds like you
too. They never sing so loud as when you are
in the shop."</p>

<p>While he was speaking we heard footsteps coming
quickly down Henwood street around the corner.
They were quick, sharp footsteps that rang
on the frosty air. "It's curious," said the cobbler,
"how footsteps sound here. I think it's the
Cathedral walls that give that ringing sound."</p>

<p>We turned to watch for the approaching pedestrian.
We wondered who he was that walked
with such an eager, springing step. He turned
the corner. He faced us. Then he laughed out
loud and said, "Hello!"</p>

<p>We were, for a second, simply staggered. We
made incoherent noises like young animals.
Then we were snatched by rough tweed arms, a
small, stiff moustache rasped our cheeks,
and&mdash;"Father!" we squealed, at last, in chorus.</p>

<p>"I found I could catch an early train," he said,
"so I just hopped on, for I was in a desperate
hurry to see you. What are you doing here, at
this hour?" He stared at the cobbler.</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Martindale," I explained. "He
mends our boots, and tells us stories, and he's got
a bird named Coppertoes."</p>

<p>"So you are a friend of my boys," said father.
"Ay. And they're grand little lads, sir. I
have a daughter of my own I'm very proud of,
sir. She was lost for seventeen years, and your
sons helped me to find her."</p>

<p>His daughter came to the door then to call him
to breakfast. She had a yellow braid over each
shoulder, and Coppertoes was sitting on her wrist
with a piece of chickweed in his bill. Father
stopped to admire them both.</p>

<p>"By George," he said, when we had left them,
"if all your friends are as interesting as those, I
should like to meet them."</p>

<p>"They are that," I said, happily, "and here's
another of them."</p>

<p>It was Granfa, standing at the gate, his blue
eyes staring with amazement. He raised his
broom to his shoulder and stood at attention as
we drew near.</p>

<p>"What a sight for the nation!" he exclaimed.
"Welcome home my dear son-in-law. I be terrible
proud to hand my charges over to 'ee. Us
have got along famous while you was over to
South Ameriky."</p>

<p>I trembled for fear father should say something
to hurt Granfa's feelings, but he seemed to
understand him at once, and shook him by the
hand, and made him a present of some tobacco
on the spot.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" screamed Mrs. Handsomebody.
"Davy!" "Mr. Curzon!" She
clutched her curl-papers in one hand and the
front of her purple wrapper in the other. "We
did not expect you for an hour yet."</p>

<p>Father laughed. "Well, I've saved you some
of the trouble of preparing by coming early.
How very well you are looking. And how well-cared-for
the children. I'm delighted. I think
I shall take them over to the hotel where my
luggage has been sent and have a talk with them
and come back later. Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Handsomebody insisted that he have
a proper breakfast, and installed us in the parlour
while she retired to assume the decent
armour of the day.</p>

<p>Father sat facing the stuffed birds. He put
The Seraph on his knee, and Angel and I hung
on either side of him. We were suddenly shy of
him, and it seemed enough to be near him, and to
feel the all-surrounding power and protection of
him. His cheeks were incredibly sun-browned,
with a ruddy glow beneath; his moustache and
the hair at his temples were almost golden. I
liked the greenish grey of his tweed suit that
seemed to match his clear, wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>He made a wry face at the stuffed birds and
then he whispered: "Old chaps, have you been
happy here?"</p>

<p>We nodded. The past was gone. What did
it matter! "Oh, but, we want to be wiv you!
Don't leave us," breathed The Seraph, burrowing
his face into the rough tweed shoulder.</p>

<p>Angel and I burrowed against him too. "Don't
leave us again," we whispered.</p>

<p>He began to kiss us, and to rumple our heads,
and to bite The Seraph's cheek. The Seraph,
drunk with joy, jumped down, and pulling open
the door of the glass case tried to drag a lovebird
from its perch to present to father. We
were just able to stop him when our governess
returned.</p>

<p>She was dignified and smiling, in black satin
and a gold chain. Mary Ellen had the breakfast
laid in the dining-room and we sat about him,
watching him eat. With what admiration we beheld
his masterful attack on the bacon and eggs!
It became awe when we saw the quantity of marmalade
that he spread upon his toast.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Handsomebody beamed fatuously
at him!</p>

<p>Between mouthfuls he talked. "Do you remember
how I used to call you Wiggie? And
the time I hid the white rat in your bonnet box?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Handsomebody cackled. The Seraph
kicked the table leg, unreproved. I drifted after
Mary Ellen to the kitchen. "Isn't he fine?" I
bragged.</p>

<p>"Divil a finer," agreed she.</p>

<p>"And 'tis yersilf, Masther John," she added,
"is the very spit av him. Shure it's you should
be the proud bye."</p>

<p>"And, Mary Ellen, you are to come and live
with us, you know, and have all the 'followers'
you want."</p>

<p>"Och," she laughed, "I'm done wid followers,
me dear. To tell ye the truth, Mr. Watlin and
I are plannin' to git hitched up, before the New
Year. An uncle of his have died and left him
enough to start him in the butcherin' business on
his own account. So maybe you'll dance at me
weddin' yet."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a nice present, Mary Ellen,
dear," I promised, putting my arm around her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on, squeezing me, "and the
cook next door was tellin' me last night, that the
word is goin' about that Miss Margery an'
Misther Harry is engaged too. So there's love
in the air, Masther John. D'ye mind the time
'twas yersilf was in love wid little Miss Jane?
Bless yer little heart."</p>

<p>I fled back to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mary Ellen was now dispatched to blow her
whistle for a hansom, and almost before we realized
it we found ourselves rolling smoothly to the
hotel where father was to stay.</p>

<p>Next, we were in his very room, exploring,
with adventurous fingers, all his admirable,
tobacco-smelling belongings. When his back was
turned, Angel even unsheathed his razor and
flourished it, for one hair-lifting second. But
father caught him and promised that he should
become acquainted with the razor-strop also, if
he grew too bold.</p>

<p>We went out and bought chocolates and toys
and brought them back to his room to play with.
The morning passed in a delicious dream. Then
luncheon downstairs with him, the eyes of many
people on us.</p>

<p>Among them I discovered, before long, the
laughing blue eyes of Lady Simon. She was not
looking at me, but very eagerly at father, as
though she were trying to make him see her. In
a moment she succeeded, and, without a word of
explanation to us he jumped up and strode across
to the table where she and Lord Simon sat.
The Seraph ran after him and was gathered into
her arms while she smiled and talked to father
over his curls.</p>

<p>"Wonder if she's askin' him for another lapis
lazarus necklace," said Angel, his mouth full of
charlotte russe, "she'd better not, 'cos we're all he
can afford now."</p>

<p>I did not like the idea either, so when father
came back with The Seraph hanging to his coat
tails, I remarked, with some asperity:</p>

<p>"She said you nearly ruined yourself once to
buy her a pair of cream-coloured ponies."</p>

<p>"Yes, and a lapis lazarus necklace," added Angel,
accusingly.</p>

<p>"I want a cweam-culled pony!" shouted The
Seraph.</p>

<p>Father leaned over us with almost the expression
of Mrs. Handsomebody in his eye.</p>

<p>"You shall all have ponies," he said, "any old
colour you like, cream, or pink, or blue, if you'll
shut up and be good."</p>

<p>Dazzled by the vision of a herd of rainbow-coloured
ponies we suffered ourselves to be led
in silence from the dining-room. Outside, father
said, still with the look of Mrs. Handsomebody
in his eye:</p>

<p>"I have to make a call on a lady in Argyle
Road, my godmother. Do you feel prepared to
come, and be good boys, or shall I send you back
to your governess?"</p>

<p>"Argyle Road!" exclaimed Angel. "That's
where Giftie lived."</p>

<p>"Want to see Giftie!" came from The Seraph,
"and Colin."</p>

<p>"Are you going to be good?"</p>

<p>"Rather," said Angel. "Please take us."</p>

<p>Another hansom was called. We were quite
prepared to see it stop before the large square
house where Giftie lived. It stopped. There
was a clamour of barks from three Scottish terriers
as we entered the gate. In a second I had
Giftie in my arms; her little, hard wriggling body
pressed to my breast; her little red tongue showing
between her pointed white teeth. She was
wild with the joy of welcoming us, but Colin
walked solemnly away, his tail very much in the
air. The third dog I felt sure was one of Giftie's
pups. "His name is Tam," shouted the tall grey-haired
lady, having suddenly appeared, and I
discovered then that we were in the drawing-room,
and pulled off my cap, and smiled up at her.</p>

<p>"I've been saving him for you," she went on,
"hoping you would turn up. The other two are
sold. But Tam is for you boys, and oh, Davy,"
turning to father, "you must let me have them
for Christmas. We shall have an enormous
Christmas Tree, and look! it's beginning to
snow."</p>

<p>It was true. Great white flakes were softly
whirling past the windows, shutting us away from
the outer world. The fire seemed to burn the
brighter for them, the air seemed full of happiness
and gay adventure. We bent over our new possession
on the hearthrug in ecstasy. Tam, in ferocious
playfulness, tried to show us all part of his
body at once. But when we overcame him, and
pinned him down, he lay limply, with his tongue
out at one side, and the promise of many a future
romp in his roguish brown eyes. Giftie brought
a woollen bedroom slipper from upstairs to worry
for our amusement. Even Colin grew friendly.
The talk went on above our heads, the far-off
talk of grown-ups. But stay&mdash;it was not so incomprehensible
after all! What was it she was
saying? A pantomime! A deserving Charity.
Had tickets. Suppose we take the children.
Would it bore Davy? Davy said it wouldn't.</p>

<p>Was all our new life to be a whirl like this?
Now we were back in the hansom cab bowling
through the madly dancing snowflakes. Now we
were back at Mrs. Handsomebody's having tea
with a double portion of jam; being scrubbed and
brushed, and warned of our behaviour, sliding
on the slippery soles of new boots; sniffing the
fresh linen of clean handkerchiefs; watching Mrs.
Handsomebody tie her bonnet strings with trembling
fingers.</p>

<p>In a four-wheeler now, squeezed very closely
together; the wheels moving heavily through the
ever-deepening snow; lights flashing by the snowy
windows, father's leg and boot pressing against
me cruelly but giving a delicious sense of protection
and good fellowship. Then the blazing
light, and heat, and pressing crowd of the lobby;
a sense of terror lest the pompous man who took
tickets would refuse to accept those tendered by
father; immense relief, as a thin, bounding individual
led us down the sloping aisle. Father's
guiding hand on our shoulders; we were in our
seats.</p>

<p>On my right sat father, and beyond him Angel.
On my left The Seraph and Mrs. Handsomebody,
her hands clasped tensely in her lap. But who
was that in the golden light beyond Angel? Who
indeed but our old friend Captain Pegg who had
come, it appeared, with Giftie's mistress. Lucky
Angel to be next him, laughing and whispering
with him! Then, lucky me to be pushed between
the seats to shake his hand.</p>

<p>"Shiver my timbers, John," he whispered, "but
I have great days to tell you of! Days of
plunder and bloodshed, my hearty. I went back
to the old life, for a while, you know. Look
here!" He drew aside his coat and around his
waist I saw that he wore a belt of alligator skin
into which was thrust a curved and glittering
bowie knife!</p>

<p>The curtain was going up. I was pulled back
into my seat. My pulses throbbed as scene by
scene the pantomime was disclosed before my
happy eyes. Here was I, John Curzon, part of
quite as good a play as yon. Pirates, love, fluttering
banners, swashbuckling clowns, life
stretched before me, a jolly adventure with Angel
and The Seraph always there to share the fun.
Now the Seraph's head had dropped to Mrs.
Handsomebody's lap. He was half asleep. Her
black kid hand patted his back. She was gazing
with a rapt smile at the stage.</p>

<p>The pantomime was nearly over. The night
of danger and dark alarm was past. Rosy morning
broke upon the mountain side, and Columbine,
reclining in a pearl-pink shell, opened her eyes and
smiled upon a flowery world.</p>

<p>I felt father's cheek against my head. His
hand covered mine. He whispered:</p>

<p>"Happy, John?"</p>

<p>I nodded, clutching his fingers. And so we
met the New Day together.</p>
